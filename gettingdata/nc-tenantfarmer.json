Hugh Johnson, who lives\nat 323 Henry St., is the deceased's\nbrother. Jack Story is a half\nbrother. The Grover Ricks family,\nliving at 1014 Madison St., and the\nTom Manry family, living at 912\nHenry St., are cousins of Mr. and\nMrs. Johnson.\nsnots were neard at the Johnson\nfarm Monday afternoon by a Negro\nnamed Kindred who went to the\nfarm and saw the bleeding bodies\nof Johnson, his wife, Mrs. Callie\nJohnson, and their four-year-old\ndaughter, Shirley, lying on the\nground near the front of the\nhouse. He immediately notified\nSheriff T. B. Bell, who, with Com\nmonwealth’s Attorney Junius W.\nPulley and his deputies, hastened\nto the scene.\nSheriff Bell and Commonwealth’s\nAttorney Pulley viewed the bodies,\nand stated that the wife and child\ncame to their deaths from gunshot\nwounds inflicted by Johnson, and\nthe man died of self-inflicted\nwounds.\nReconstructing the crime, Sheriff\nBell said that Johnson shot his\nWife, who ran from the house, and\nfell in the yard; the little girl, evi\ndently on the front porch, was shot\nthrough the heart, and was thought\nto have died instantly; Johnson\nthen turned the gun upon himself\nand shot off most of his head.\nThe weapon used in the triple\nkilling was found at Johnson’s side.\nThe only member of the little\nfamily left alive was a six-year-old\nboy. William Johnson, .Tr. He was\nat school. When the school bus\nwas bringing him home, it was\nstopped and the child taken off\nand carried to the home of his\nmaternal grandfather, Thomas\nWorrell, to keep him from visiting\nthe tragic scene at the lad’s own\nhouse.\nThe shots, the sheriff said, were\nheard by some of the men working\nin a nearby sawmill, but they did\nnot go to the scene. They said\nlater that Johnson had been angry\nwith his wife and had been quar\nreling with her for several days.\nKnowledge of their bitter rela\ntions, it was said, prompted them\nnot to go to the house when they\nheard the shots.\nJohnson was 30 years old.

Life will\nhold little for him. A terrible pic\nture.\nThat is a terrible picture, but the\nfollowing one will probably be a\ntruer one: Thirty years from now\nTharrington will be a retired bus\niness man. The murder of Mac\nMillan along with its sordid de\ntails will be only an unpleasant\nmemory. The three or four (if\nany) years he spends in prison will\nbe but a hazy dream to him. For\nTharrington is not tenant farmer,\na weaver, a mechanic, or a negro;\nhe will not stay long in the pen.\nAre paroles and pardons justifi\nable? I will not go into that, not\nknowing the answers. But I will\nsay that the community and the\nstate would not suffer greatly if\nthey lost both the murdered Mac\nMillan and the murderer Tharring\nton.\n“Is golf fun?” That question may\nbe asked about almost any of the\nmore strenuous sports of the U\nnited States today. Americanism\ndemands that we excel in anything\nif we participate. The English, I\nunderstand, play for fun. That is\nwhy, I judge, our score is usually\nbetter than theirs in a competitive\nmeet. Let it be so. For in that\nway 'both are winners—we get the\n“victory” and they get the fun.\n—o—\nThe playgrounds have been a\ngreat help, undoubtedly.

If we\nlove one another, God dwelleth in\nus, and his love is perfected in us.\nHereby know we that we dwell in\nhim, and he in us, because he hath\ngiven us of his Spirit.

(UP)—Tenant houses ate for\n| rent on a plantation near this\n| northeast Louisiana town, where\ntwo industrial farmers have turn\nI ed night into day with tractors\ni dragging plows in eight-hour\nj shifts.\nThe mule has heen replaced hv\n| the machines doing 10 times as\nmuch work; the tenant-farmer has\ngiven way to the tractor driver,\nand the blacksmith's forge has\nI become a mechanic's lathe. Only\n7(1 families now live on the Olive\nl>ell plantation, where 150 once\nI worked.\nTwo born mule-farmers. \\V. T.\nMitchiner and K. S.

And they pay otl\nin cash every two weeks. Voelker\nsaid the industrial revolution had\ncome to the farm, and come to\nstay. To operate success* ully.,\nhowever, the farmer must have\nsound equipment and organi'/.e\nwell. He said the venture nearly'\nbroke the partners twice because\nthey had inferior equipment and\norganization.\nAnother advantage of night\nplowing is thai it's not only cool\ner. but the tractor driver has few\ner distractions. No one stops to\nchat; he can't see what other peo\nple are doing, and stop to watch.\nThe tractors have been fitted tor\nnight duty at about 1 o each.\nLights used are taken from <»bl\nautomobiles, and generators and\nbatteries installed.\nWith six tractors and IS drivers\nthe 2,400-acre plantation is culti\nvated. The fields are laid out t\"\nexpedite dusting the cotton by\nairplane. Anything breaking the\nsmoothness of the terrain is ironed\nout. if possible, for the plane\nskims the ground with wheels a\nscant two-feet above the stalks.\nOWN GIN OPERATED\nThe cotton, about 1.000 to I ,\n500 bales annually, is ginned on\nthe plantation.\nVoelker pointed '«> Olive Dell\nas proof that the tenant-farmer\nsystem is all wrong. He offered\nthe cash pay svstem <>n the plan\ntation as solution of the bitterness\noften arising between landlord\nand tenant over credit at commis\nsaries. As the landlord loses\nmoney. \\ oelker explained, he\nraises prices in the commissary to\nrecoup, and since the tenant has\nno cash, he can't buy anywhere\nelse.\nHe said also that land cannot\nsupport so many people, and that\nthe fewer the tenants, the fewer\nthe mouths to feed from the pro- j\nduce.\nMethods developed at Olive Dell\nare being used now on lnglewood\nplantation near Alexandria, La.,\nowned hv C.

Far «»ff in the\nhorizon, she could see a narrow,\ndark shore line marking the divi-J\nsion between green-blue sky ami i\ndeep-blue sea. That was Bermuda1\nin the distance, and in another J\nfew hours she would be walking\nin the shadow of its royal palms.\nThat is, provided she decided to\nleave the ship. . . . She recalledj\nshe had no shore tickets.\nShe could not know that direct\nly above her the decision was be-(\ninjr made.\n\"I'll arrange everything with.\nMiss Milner,\" .Mrs. Porter was ex\nplaining to Isobel. \"You shall\nspend the day with Richard. And\nbe careful, Isobel. Be very care\nful. Don't speak about .Miss Mil\nner at all; don't disparage her in\nany way. The young man has a\nprotective feeling toward her,1\nnatturally. He feels responsible\n. . . not that I believe she had any\nhundred dollars in her bag.\"\nIsobel, dainty in her pink negli-l\ngee. her blond curls tucked care-!\nfully under a net cap, looked dis-j\ndaitiful. \"She's just a stenogra\npher,\" she pointed out.\nHer mother sighed. \"There are\ntimes when I wish you were a\nstenographer, too. A girl in busi\nness has opportunities. . . . Now\nhurry and get to the dining room\nwhile I speak to her.\" |\nA moment later she knocked on\nthe door of C-214. Joyce opened\nit expectantly.\n\"On, irood morning, Mrs. Por\nter.\"\n\"Good morning, my dear. Are\nyou feeling better?\"\n\"I'm so well that I believe it\nwas all imagination.\"\n\"Not at all. Your first trip, you |\nknow. 1 suppose we're hardened\nto such weather—oh. it does both\ner Isobel, terriblv, hut\" she man\naged to get to dinner . . . Hut\nnow. m.v dear. I've been worrying\nabout you. You didn't, 1 hope,\nlose your shore excursion tickets.\nOr hadn't you bought them?\"\nJoyce smiled ruefully. \"Yes, T\nbought them—\"\n\"And they were in your bag,\ntoo? How unfortunate! How very\ndistressing!\" She shook her head\nsympathetically. \"However, I be\nlieve I can manage a way for\nyou.\"\n\"That's very kind of you, Mrs.\nPorter.\"\n\"Nonsense? That's what I'm on\nthe ship for, you know, to see that\neverybody has a good time.\" She!\nsmiled disarmingly. \"Now there'*\na trip ashore today—really, my\ndeac. I wouldn't want you to miss\nit.\"\n^ \"I would like to go,\" Joyce ad\nmitted honestly, \"if there were\nanw way—\"\n• * •\n\"There is a way—as my assist\nant. Usually I ask one of the\nstewardesses, or, as in your case,\none of the younger passengers.\nAll you do is collect the tickets\nfor me, at the carriage station in\nHamilton. And see that the guests\nare assigned to the carriages and\nstarted off promptly. Then we'll\nall go together, you and Isobel\nand Mr. Hamilton and I, in the\nlast carriage.\"\nJoyce was delighted. \"It's love\nly of you to do this. Mrs. Porter.\"\nshe said gratefully. \"Under the\ncircumstances I wasn't even sure\nof going ashore—\"\n\"I know, my dear^ And a young\ngirl nowadays doesn't like to be\ndependent. . . . Will you be ready\nto go ashore in the first tender\nwith me?\" she asked.\n\"Yes. I'll have breakfast im\nmediately.\"\n\"Are you ready now? We can\ngo in together . . .\"\nThey found Isobel and I)r. Gray\nalone at the table. Mr. Gregory\nwas probably still sleeping off ijis\nseasickness, the doctor ventured,\nand young Mr. Hamilton had eat\nen half an hour ago. He was prob\nably up on deck, looking about for\nsomeone, he added, with a sly\nwink at Joyce. A moment later\nIsobel excused herself.\nDick was standing alone at the\nhead of the gangplank leading\ndown to the tender when Joyce\nw«-nt upstairs. Already a good\nnumber of pasesngers were as\nsembled. all eager to go ashore\non this first boat.' He called to\nher. and drew her out of range of\nthe crowd.\n\"You're going ashore wfth me,\naren't y«»u, * Joyce?\"- he asked\nhopefally. * . . '•\n\"I'd love to, Dick, but—\"f\n\"l!ut what?\"\nM rs. Porter asked me to be her\nassistant on the shore excursion,\nand I promised that I would.\"\nHe frowned. \"You don't have\nto do anything like that, Joyce.\"\n\"Kut I want to. I'm terribly\ngrateful for the opportunity. And\nwe'll all be together, Dick.\"\n\"Who is all?\"\n\"The Porters, you and I. We'll\ntake the last carriage.\"\n\"I prefer carriages for two. I\ndon't see why you won't go with\nme, Joyce. I asked you, yester\nday.\"\nShe hesitated. \"I know you did,\nDick. But please excuse me. I'd\nmuch rather have it this way.\"\nHe shrugged. \"Well, then that's\nall there is to it, I suppose.\"\n* * *\nThey started over together on\nthe tender, and Dick said no more\nabout it. Presently the Potters\njoined them, and Isobel immedi\nately slipped her arm through his\nand carried him off to the other\nside of the little boat, to have\nhim point out certain landmarks.\nMrs. Porter bustled about, arrang\ning last minute details, and Joyce\nstood at the rail alone, delighting\nin the beauties of this lovely lit\ntle island.\nDrawing alongside me wnari,\nMi*s. Porter gave last minute in\nstructions. Joyce took her stand\neagerly, but soon she was beset\nwith difficulties which Mrs. Por\nter had not explained. Some pas\nsengers wanted to change their\nplans at this last minute. \"Mr.\nSmith and I met some friends\ncoming over on the tender; can't\nwe have a carriage for four in\nstead of two?\" Or \"my daughter\nhas taken sick this morning: may\nI exchange her ticket, please?\"\nThese, and innumerable others. In\na few minutes, Joyce felt as if she\nwere the center of a busy day in\nthe stock exchange.\nDuring one of the most harass\ning arguments, a colored boy\ncame up to her with a message:\n\"Miss Phtuh says she got to g»»\nahai'd . . . she'll meet you after\nwhile.\" _ ■ * .\nForty minutes later, Joyce saw\nher last charge safely installed in\nthe last carriage. And not until\nthen, when she was standing alone\nat the carriage stand, did she real\nize that the Porters, and the last\ncarriage, had gone off without\nher!\n\"Morning, Miss M:.lner.\"\nOne of the ship's officers, a\nyoung man from the purser's of\nfice, stood beside her, and she\ncralized that the second tender\nwas docking.\n\"Did you miss your party?\" he\nasked.\n\"So it seems—\"\n\"That's toutfh.\" He remember\ned suddenly that Miss Milner was\nthe young lady who had lo^t her\npocketbook.

C., SEPT. 22, 1938\nIS THE WATER FIT TO DRINK?\nMany farmers in McDowell coun\nty are becoming interested in the in\nstallment of private water systems\nfor their homes. Some already have\nput in hydraulic rams and automatic\nelectric pumns.\nOne of the best arguments we\nhave noticed in favor of equiping the\nfarm homes with some modern type\nof water system was found in the\nform of a joke in a little booklet\ncalled \"Better Farm Equipment and\nMethods.\" It ran like this:\n\"Some time ago I saw a tenant\nfarmer and one of his boys carrying\nwater from a spring which ran out\nof the side of a hill, forming a pool\nin the mud in the middle of the\npasture,\" states R. Montgomery,\nvice-president Louisville Gas and\nElectric Company. \"I inquired if\nthey used this water for drinking\npurposes the year around and he re\nplied that they used it as long as it\nwas good but when it went bad they\nobtained water elsewhere.\n\"I asked him how he knew when\nthe water wasn't fit to drink and he\nsaid he could always tell because the\n'kids got the dysentery'.\"\nFarmers who have the progressive\nness to provide a means of keeping\ntheir water supply clean and pure\nat all seasons of the year do not have\nto risk the lives of members of their\nfamily including themselves to find\nout if the water is fit to drink.\nTHE INDIANS WERE TAME\nIn McDowell county and in many\nother parts of the country, it is not\nunusual for people to find old Indian\narrow heads, stone battle axes or\nclubs, stone scalping knives, and\nother barbarous implements of an\ncient Indian warfare* When some of\nus find these relics, we reflect upon\nthe people who used them and call\nthem savages. The crude weapons\nused by the Indians were ineffectual\nunless they made a direct hit upon\nthe object of the aim of the warrior\nusing them.\n\\T/\\nro/lntro iito non ViirrVi QvnlnciTro\nin sheila which burst into bits flying\nin every direction so that every liv\ning thing in the vicinity where it ex\nplodes may be killed by one or more\npieces of the metal. If one of the\nshells does not explode at the time\nit is fired from the gun it may be\nexploded years afterward by being\nstruck by some object. Since the\ntime of the World War, many far\nmers plowing in the old battlefields\nof Europe have been killed by these\nold shells when their plows struck\nthem.\nYet any one of us would be insul\nted if someone called us savages.\nAs we see it, modern warfare is\nmuch more barbarous and savage\nthan the worst deeds perpetrated by\nthe Indians; but we continue to\nmake it more horrible.\nToday, war clouds are hovering\nso low over Europe again that they\nform a dense fog out of which might\nemerge such inhuman warfare that\nthe Indians would turn face down\nin their graves to hide from it could\nthey know of it.\nSEPTEMBER\nGrace Stoner Clark, of Illinois,\nwrites of September in the Religious\nTelescope:\nTo us September means dusty\nroadsides aflame with golden rod;\ncool back porches shaded with bright\nblue morning glories or purple-berri\ned woodbine; gardens browned bj\nsummer heat; fragrance from hillside\nvineyards and rosy-cheeked apples\nrippling corn bending with ripening\nears; shorter days; crisp nights\nkaty-dids screeching in the twilight\na promise of frost soon to come\nSeptember means school again anc\na vague loneliness in the hearts oJ\nlast Junes care-free graduates; bus\niness picks up; straggling vacation\nists return; social activities begin\nchurches take on new life. .

It is owned by\nyou and me. But there is a lot more\nto be said for encouraging the indi\nvidual to write letters or just one\nletter in some cases.\nIn the present day scheme of\nthings, families are so widely divided\nthat many a mother does not know\nwhere her \"wandering boy\" is to\nnight. She yearns constantly for a\nword from him. A letter from him\nwould be genuinely appreciated.\nLetter writing is an art which may\nbe improved by practice. There are\nmany and various kinds of letters\nwhich may be written for different\nreasons. There are letters of love,\nappreciation, thanks, sales, admira\ntion, request, sympathy, condolence.\nAll of these types of letters may be\nappreciated by the recipient if they\nare properly written, and many of\nthem might bring joy to the one who\nreceives them regardless of how they\nmay be written and regardless of the\nkind of material used for stationery.\nIf you are away from home and\nthose who love you, take a few min\nutes to write a letter to them. It\nwill cost only a few pennies, very\nlittle trouble, and it will be such a\npleasure and comfort to those who\nare waiting for a word from you.\nMaybe it is the other way around\nThere may be some member of the\nfamily away from home who is\nyearning to hear some news from\nhome.\nYou may know a friend who is\nconfined on account of accident or\nillness. A kind thought from you in\nthe form of a letter may bring some\nadded joy into that lonely life. There\nmay be some aged person who be\nfriended you when you were a little\n! child. A letter of appreciation from\nyou now would help wonderfully to\nrepay that kindness.\nNational Letter Writing Week is\nso full of suggestions for a touch of\nkindness that there is no limit to its\npossibilities.\n—\nPRODUCTION UP\n! Although the number of milk\n'cows in North Carolina decreased\n1 per cent in the past year, the av\nerage daily milk production jumped\nfrom 12.9 pounds per cow to 13.2\npounds, says John Arey, extension\ndairyman at State College.\nNORTH CAROLINA IN LEAD\nNorth Carolina, with a 5 per ceni\nincrease in farm income during tta\nfirst seven months of 1938, was the\nonly South Atlantic state to show a\n;gain over the same period in 1937.\n| There would be few wars if the\ncasualties were known before 'the fir\ning begun.\n1\nWHO PAYS THE BILL?\nThe question, \"Who pays for the\nadvertising-?\" is all too often dismiss\ned with the apparently plausible an\nswer, \"the customer.\" But capable\n! advertising authorities and careful\n| analysts are agreed that the answer\n| is wrong: that the non-advertising\nmerchant pays for the advertising\nmerchant's advertising.\nAnd they arrive at their conclusion\nin this way. While the merchant who\n] contracts for the advertising, formal\nj ly issues a check to pay for it, the in\nj creased business that is his because\nof his aggressiveness, comes mainly\nj from trade drawn from the non-ad\nj vertiser. It follows, then, that the\nj latter is the one who pays the bill.\n| Some merchants proceed on the\nI theory that advertising is an unnec\n, essary expense that must be added\nj to the selling price of the merchan\ndise, and they try to impress that 011\ntheir customers. But just the same\ni the buyer continues, in increasing\nnumbers and volume, to patronize\nthe merchant who considers advertis\ning not an expense but an investment\nThis is accentuated, if not proved,\nby the fact that the merchant who\nspends two per cent of his gross sales\non advertising, shows a less percen\ntage of profit than his neighbor who\nspends three and a half per cent on\n; advertising.\nI Restricted volume means restricted\ni turnover, and the two add up to re\n| stricted profits. And restricted profits\n; simply means restricted service,\nj And there is where the customer\ni comes in: If the merchant with small\n! volume would keep head above water,\nhe must maintain price levels at all\ntimes. Because his turnover is cur\ntailed, his shelves carry merchandise\nthat is'undesirable, and as undesira\n: bly priced. To this slow turnover,\n; then, may he charged the fact that\n1 customers are attracted away from\nhim to his competitors who offer\nfresher merchandise in the newer\nstyles. Thierefore he is the one who\npays.\nIt is something that both merchant\nand customer can well turn over in\ntheir minds. For it very definitely af\nfects both of them.—The Statesville\ni Landmark.\n!\nI\nj ■ — ■■ ■\nWe will be closed\nMonday\nand\nTuesday\nSeptember 26 and 27\nfor\nRosh Hashona 1\nThe Jewish \"Holiday.\nAt this time we extend\nbest wishes to all our\nfriends everywhere, !\nMARION\nBARGAIN STORE\nL. Nussbaum\nREPUBLIC of CZECHOSLOVAKIA\nCzechoslovakia is a central Euro\npean Republic, slightly larger than\nthe state of Arkansas. Compared with\nthe area of North Carolina, it is larg\ner by some 1,824 square miles,\nNorth Carolina having an area of\n52,426 miles and Czechoslovakia\nhaving an erea of 54,250 square\nmiles. East and west, it m«asures\nabout 600 miles, while North Caro\nlina's greatest width is a little more\nthan 501 miles. From North to\nSouth Czechoslovakia measures from\n50 to 100 miles, and North Caroli\nna's largest distance from north to\nsouth is 187 ^ miles. The forests\nof Czechoslovakia cover 32 per cent\nof its area.\nThis lrltle republic lies in the heart\nof Central Europe, being hemmed in\non the north by Germnay and Po\nland, on the south by Roumania,\nHungary and Austria, on the east by\nPoland, and on the west by Ger\nmany. It was part of the Austro\nHungarian Empire until the World\nWar, and was made up of Bohemia,\nMoravia, part of Silesia, Slovakia\nand Carpo Russiana, having been\nformed October 28, 1918. One of\nthe richest agricultural states in Eu\nrope, the land is held largely by\npeasants, following the 1924 land\nreform which resulted in the seques\ntration of the large estates of the\nAustrian aristocracy.\nDr. Edward Benes was elected\npresident of the Republic Decem\nber 18, 1935, succeeding Professor\nT.

Kirksey Has Collection\nSaid To Surpass All Others\nIn Western Carolina.\nIn any direction which one may\n(drive .from Marion or on any road\nin McDowell county may be found\npicturesque panoramas or precipi\ntous perspectives unsurpassed for\nsheer beauty anywhere in the world.\nOne of these delightful drives may\nbe found by leaving Marion by way\nof South Main street and turning off\non almost any of the left-hand side\nroads which will lead one eventually\nto Dysartsville and beyond.\nThe main Dysartsville road is\nplairily designated by road signs and\nis paved for only a short distance\nafter leaving the Rutherfordton\nhighway. All of the roads to Dy\nsartsville are secondary roads and\nare more or less rough in stretches,\nbut the scenery is well worth the lit\ntle discomfort which may be found\nin traveling over the unsmooth sec\ntions.\nAside from the natural rugged\nness and boundless beauty on every\nhand, one may also meet with the\nmost unexpected surprises in the\nleast suspected surroundings.\nJust beyond Dysartsville on the\nway to Rutherfordton, a stranger to\nthe section comes suddenly upon an\nopen space which widens out be\ntween the hills on either side to\nform a lovely lawn the velvety ver\ndure of which is marred only by the\nusual ugliness of a combination\nconfectionary and service station,\nbut also enhanced by the sparkling\nspurt from a flowing fountain above\na pretty pool.\nApparently there is no special in\nducement for the traveler to tarry,\nbut those who do find a proprietor\nwith a pleasing personality and hav\ning prehistoric possessions in a min\niature museum. The curio collection\nis concealed in an inconspicuous ap\nartment over the store, and is com\nposed of relics of the Redmen.\nThe unique arrangement of the\nunusual array permits the professor\nTHE\nCHARLOTTE\nOBSERVER\n\"The Foremost Newspaper\nof The Carolinas\"\nJas.

IT MUST BE GOOD!\nJUST HUMANS\nBy GENE CAftR\nThe Daredevil\nto propound to the public the history\nof Indian industry from the crudest\nimplement to the most ingenious in\nvention of his intrepid instinct.\nThe owner of the place is E. F.\nKirksey. It has been said that his\ncollection of Indian relics surpasses\nthat owned by the Cherokee Indians\nthemselves at their reservation in\nWestern North Carolina. He has ar\nrowheads, spearheads, beads, trink\nkets, made of the finest gems. It is\nsupposed that the arrowheads, spear\nheads, and dart heads made out of\nthese precious stones were used on\nly in some of the Indians' ceremon\nials. They are beautiful things of\nwonderful coloring and varying in\ntheir degrees of transparency or\nopaqueness. The dart head is the\nsmali tip U9ed on the little arrow\nwhich is blown from a blow gun.\nMr. Kirksey has some of the blow\nguns in his museum, and he is an\nexpert himself with the instrument,\nas was demonstrated.\nOne of the most interesting divis\nions of the collection to many obser\nvers is that which shows the queer\ndevices used by the medicine men.\nSome of his equipment, however,\naside from the frightful \"charms\":\nsupposed to chase away evil spirits, j\nis not unlike that used in our mod-1\nsrn pharmacies except, of course,\n;hey are fashioned crudely for lack!\nof better facilities for making them.\nThere one sees the mortar, pestle,\nand other familiar vessels for pre\nparing pellets and potions.\nA convincing demonstration was\ngiven to substantiate a theory that\nBetsy Ross obtained her idea of the\nfive-pointed star for the U. S. Flag\nfrom the Cherokee Indians. The em\nblem appears on many of their own\nsymbols which were made long be\nfore the time of the creation of the\nUnited States Banner, and it can be\nmade perfectly by laying one spear\nhead upon another in a certain man\nner.\nOne interesting display in the mu\nseum is entirely typical of the white\nman's invasion into this territory\nwhere only Indians once abounded.\nIt is a crude, home-made, blockade\ndistilling outfit. It was captured by\nrevenue officers and turned over to\nMr. Kirksey after first having been\nrendered useless, because it bears his\nname in plain lettering. Mr. Kirksey\nof course, had nothing to do with the\nmaking or operation of the illicit\ndevice, but it was made from a met\nal sign which once hung in front of\nhis place and was stolen for the pur\npose of making the distillery by the\nmoonshiners. The cap of the \"still\"\nalso was made from an old lard\nbucket.\nShow cases arranged near the dis\nplay stand of the blockade still are\nfilled with indian implements which\nare good evidence that their entire\ntime was not spent in fighting, scalp\ning, hunting, and fishing. It would\nbe easy to imagine that our most\nmodern garden tools were incepted\nin the minds of the American Indi\nans. Their hoes, plows, etc., although\nthe blades are made of stone and at\ntached to wooden handles, could be\nused as models by which to make the\nones we use today.\nWhile being steeped in Indian lore\nthe visitor has in store still another\npleasant surprise. The genial guide\nwho has so graciously explained all\nof the marvelous findings, most of\nwhich were excavated from the\ngraves of Indians, is a musician of\nno mean talent. His hands, those of\na man on the shady side of middle\nage, and probably accustomed to\nmany menial tasks about his daily\nroutine, are as nimble as those of a\nyouth. Hidden under a velvet cover\ning on a dais at the front of the\nroom, is a beautiful harp (and we do\nnot mean a mouth organ for moun\ntain music which sometimes is given\nthe name of harp). Mr. Kirksey fin\ngers the strings on his harp to tunes\nrequiring the most difficult techni\nque and tempo. He plays anything\nfrom the classics to the frivolous'\nfantasys. On the occasion of our vis-1\n: it we were charmed with the beauti\nful strains of the Spanish dance, \"La:\nPaloma,\" and then a waltz requiring1\nrapid fingering with all of its beau\ntiful variations.\nMr. Kirksey has erected a new;\n; building into which his museum soon\nwill be moved. Better lighting and\neasy access will be some of the ad\nvantages of the new location beside\nhis store.\nBEETS PROVE TO BE\nA PROFITABLE CROP\nFOR T. H. BARTLETT!\nT. H. Bartlett, McDowell county\ndairyman-trucker, finds the garden\nvariety of beets the most profitable\nof truck crops grown on his farm.\nTrying an experiment with beets!\nfor feed as well as for table use, Mr. j\nBartlett, early in the spring, inves-l\nted 60 cents in beet seed of the j\nblood red and Egyptian varieties, j\nThe seed were sown in 13 rows of:\nabout 100 feet each on land well fer\ntilized with rotted manure from his\nbarn lot.\nFrom the 13 rows Mr. Bartlett\nsaid he harvested 40 bushels for the ,\nlocal market besides all that was '\nneeded for family use and consider- i J\nable for feed. \"I found a ready mar-!'\nket at $1 a bushel for all I had to j\nsell,\" he said, \"and estimating the ■'\nhome consumption at the same value\nthe beets netted more than $50 on\nthe investment.\"\nAnother thing in favor of the beet\nthe dairyman said, it is less subject\nto disease and blight than most other\ntruck and is excellent feed for cows\nand chickens.\" I\nFLETCHER ACCEPTS U.

'\nThe Democratic nomination of!\n3heridan Downey over Senator Wm. j\nj. McAdoo in California Tuesday\nsmphasrized the political potentiali-.\n;ies of the voters who want more\nind bigger pensions.\nDowney campaigned as an advo\n;ate bf a system which became\ncnown as the \"$30 every Thursday\"\n>lan. He said all unemployed per\nions over 50 years of age would get\n;he equivalent of $30 a week in state\nscrip. President Roosevelt called it\ni \"fantastic shortcut to Utopia\" and\nVIcAdoo also criticized it.\nThere have been few primaries\n;his year lacking candidates with\nsome sort of pension proposal.\nSenator Claude Pepper of Florida\nirst administration supporter to win\nrenomination, campaigned as a\nrownsend plan advocate. Rep D.W.\nClark, who defeated New Deal\nSenator James P. Pope in the Idaho\nDemocratic primary, also favored\n;he Townsend plan, and in Oregon\nDoth senatorial nominees—Rufus C.\nHolman, Republican, and Willis Ma\naoney, Democrat, have advocated\n:he system.\nIn Texas, W. Lee O'Daniel won a\nsmashing primary victory for the\ngovernorship. His principal plank\n,vas a $30 monthly pension for all\npersons over 65.\nThe Democratic senatorial race in\nWashington also provides a pension\nssue. Senator Homer T. Bone is op\naosed for renomination by Otto A.\nCase of Seattle. Like Bone, Case\nsupports the Roosevelt administra\n;ion, but in addition is an ardent\nTownsendite. In Georgia William G.\nMcCrae, one of four Democratic\n:andidates for Senator, has suppor\nted the Townsend plan.\nReports from Maine, where the\nstate election will take place Sept 12\nire that pensions have been made an\nissue by various Republican candi\niates.\nTWO RUTHERFORD MEN\nARE KILLED IN WRECK\nRutherfordton, Sept. 3.— Deputy\nSheriff Jack Williams and Leslie Tan\nner, young men of Rutherfordton,\nreceived fatal injuries near Hender\nsonville when their car ran off a\njurve into a gullev, relatives here\nsvere notified today.\nWilliams was a son of Sheriff J.\nCal Williams of Rutherford county\nand had been acting as sheriff due to\nthe illness of his father.

Reams, Assistant County Agent.\nRegardless of the size of the farm,\na good dairy cow is essential to the\nhealth of the family. As a rule,\nthe smaller the farm, the greater\nthe need for a dairy cow because\nof lower income and inability to\nbuy milk, even though from a\nhealth standpoint, it is of equal im\nportance to all families including\nthe city family.\nThere are farms in Halifax Coun\nty with good cows and farms with\ncows that need improvement thru\ncareful breeding and proper feed\ning. On the other hand, there are\nfarmers with no cows at all, and\nespecially tenant farmers.\nWhen a farmer fails to have a\ngood cow, properly taken care of,\nthere is, as a rule, a general “let\ndown” in the health of the family.\nA farmer whether he be landowner\nor tenant, may expect his farm to\nbe run exactly in proportion to his\ndesire to have a good dairy cow\nand other \"live at home” livestock\nand crops on that farm. Mr.\nReams continues by saying that,\nfarmers can’t expect, as a rule, fair\nincomes from one farming enter\nprise but must increase their in\ncome by properly managing a bal\nanced combination of enterprises.\nMr. and Mrs. J.

But as soon they ac\ncent Christianity they dig up the root, bring them\ntogether and burn them in a groat fire. They all\nbecome, as a matter of course total abstainers.\nJ. T. FAIN\nC. M. OGLE\nHENRY ATKIN\nEditor\nManaging Editor\nCity Editor\n—Sunday School Chronicle.\nWHICH WAY, AMERICANS?\nWe quote a sentence from the writings of\nWalter Lippman for the daily press:\n\"Nothing can keep a nation free except\nthe conviction of its people that they would\nrather die than be slaves.\"\nThat was the conviction which enabled\nthe people of the American colonies to ob\ntain their freedom and that conviction has\nenabled this country to live and flourish for\nmjore than 150 years. Devotion to this con\nvi^tion and the principles upon which it is\nbised, together with the power of the ideals\nit| has established in American character,\nh&s made this nation great, has made it in\nmjany things a model for all the nations of\nthe earth. In addition the American social\nsystem and American application of the\nlaws of economics. American industrial and\nbusiness policies, have all made major con\ntributions to the progress and prosperity of\na country which has astonished civilization\nwith its magnificent development.\nAnd all the while, throughout its history,\nthe United States has been the foremost'\nnation of the world in its devotion to liberty,\nin devotion to the principle that the highest,\nbest and greatest development of a nation is\nto be achieved through the highest and best\ndevelopment of the character of the indivi\ndual, and this is cmly.to,be achieved through\nthe freedom of the individual and the un\ntrammelled and boundless opportunity for\nachievement, progress and development of\nthe individuial which has characterized\nI\nAmerican life.\nToday, with a large area of the world\ngroggy, dazed and tottering from the\nassaults which destructive forces are hurl\ning against the free nations of the earth, i\nagainst individual liberty and inalienable\nlights, against democratic forms of govern\nment, this nation is in the most secure posi\ntion, no doubt, of all the countries in the\nworld. It is in a favorable geographical\nposition; and despite the beatings it has\ntaken in depression and recession and the\nmistakes and failures which have ensued\nfrom effcirts to correct such conditions, this\ncountry is still able to withstand some\nsevere jolts and overcome some unfavorable\nexperiences. No other country of the world\nis so strong and so well able to meet the\ncrisis which faces civilization.\nNearly all the nations of the earth lack\nthe natural and financial resources which\nthe United States possesses in great abund-'\nance. Otherwise, no doubt, the next world\nwar would have by this time been in full\nblast. Lack of financial resources to wage\na world war is believed by some ostute ob\nservers to be the chief reason for the halt\ning attitude of certain countries which\nwant to start trouble and of countries which\nwould quickly oppose them with force were\ntheir financial condition better.\nIn the midst of impending and danger\nous world conditions, however the Ameri\ncan nation will remain free if its people\nshow the will to preserve their freedom. It\nthey have the convictijn that they would\nrather die than become the slaves of Com\nmunism, Fascism or some other alien ism,\nthey can preserve the freedom and the\ncountry which have been theirt throughout\nthe entire history of the American nation.\nLiberty loving citizens of this country,\nwho value the heritage handed down by-«\ntheir fathers, will write the words (or sim\nilar words) of Walter Lippman over their\ndoor-posts and upon the. tablets of their\nhearts—\n\"Nothing can keep a nation free except'\nthe conviction of its people that they would\nrather die than be slaves.\"\nUnless we misread the signs of the times\nthe day has come in which much more than\nlip service must be given to this fundamen\ntal principle of freedom. It must be de\nclared as a fundamental principle, our peo\nple must rally to it as such and must defend\n» it, no matter what the cost.\ni NEWSPAPERS' OPINIONS\n:!\nTHE NORTH CAROLINA REPUBLICANS\nWhatever may be thought of the action of thi\nRepublican State convention here in writing it\nplatform and assorting its political leaders for tin\nvarious present and prospective offices and post\nj of responsibility, there must be agreement that tlv\n1 body was exceedingly wise and strategic in its pro\nmotion of Hon. Jake F. Newell to'the chairmanshi]\nof the organization in North Carolina.\nMr. Newell is a patriot and a Christian gentle\n; man, and while, of course, he is thorough-going an<\nforthright in his opposition to the present Demo\n. cratic party's principles and policies and command\n' ing office holders, we hold to the conviction tha\nhe is, first of all. an American before he is i\n■ partisan.\n| And we devoutly hope that he will not para\nmount his political partisanship.\nFor that matter, it is time for all strictly party\nmen to lay aside their intensities and prejudice:\nand face the situation which prevails already, am\nthreatens to prevail in the future, with a vision un\nimpaired or colored by personal political or sec\ntional bias.\nSome critical questions press themselves in upoj\nthe intelligence and patriotic judgment of tht\npeople of this country at this moment.\nPersonalities are, relatively, of little importance\nbut principles make the difference between the lift\nand death of a republic.\nWe are not in agreement with the expressed con\nvictions of Republican leaders that the presenl\nnational leadership has determinedly set out upor\na course of action that would create a dictator\nship.\nBut we are not at all sure but that, if the pres\nen trends are continued, America will race on to\nwards the equivalent at least of dictatorial govern\nment, whatever name one may wish to apply.\nThose trends are upon the responsibilities of th»\nsovereign citizenship of America.\nThis citizenship can stop them or ncceleiat<\nthem.\nOur more unhealthy fear at times is that they\nthese Americans individual citizens, are not inter\nested in sufficient numbers to arrest these ten\ndencies to the point of'returning to the old model\nof democracy.\nFurthermore, one finds statesmen in Americt\ntoday who are wondering if civilization has not be\ncome so complex as to make it mandatory to casl\naside the old traditions and processes of democracy\n—and find some other way of government.\nThis newspaper may occasionally share that in\nstability of faith itself, but it has not abandoned\nthe hope that every desirable and virtuous objec\ntive that is within the range of what has come to\nbe known as the New Deal and can be reached\nwithin the old framework of the democratic pro\nCCSS6S.\nWhat the Republicans of North Carolina may\namount to under the leadership of Mr. Newell in\nthe way of impressing their platform and purposes\nand policies upon the people of the f?tate will bt\nawaited with interest.\nIt is certain, however, that under agile and ver\nsatile leadership of Mr. Newell, the party will be\nmilitant and dynamic, and will go to the maximum\noi its attainable goals upon the mofticatum of hi?\nhonest and intelligent as well as aggressive guid\nance.—Charlotte Observer.\nWAY OF THE DICTATOR\nWhile the world was wondering what the Austri\nan plebiscite would develop, Hitler moved German\ntroops into Austria, stopped the referendum, forc\ned the resignation of the chancellor and seized con\ntrol of the Nation.\nFrance and England, jealous of the rights of\ndemocracies, were unable to cope with the speed\nof the Hitler program. Mild protest could they\nmake but that's all. They could stop the invasion.\nThis seizure of Austria is typical.\nDictators, given power at home, consider them\nselves thus entitled to use the same force abroad.\nMussolini did it in Ethiopia; Hitler does it in\nAustria.\nTo this date it seems the Austnans will submit\nto the German authority but who can tell how long\nthis state of affairs will continue ?\nIf Hitler did not fear the Austrian independence\nwhy did he seize the reins so quickly? And if\nmajority sentiment does favor independence can he\nlong control the Austrians?\nThe episode is loaded with dynamite; there's no\ndenying that right now Europe is as close to war a?\nshe has been since 1918. Perhaps Hitler's troops\ncan crush Austria to such an extent that war will bo\naverted; perhaps this authority will serve to flash\nthe Austrian discontent into open warfare.\nDictators become power-crazed. They are born\nof excitement and must ever present excitement to\nretain their power.\nThats' why Italy and Germany talk much about\ntheir future war plans. Hitler and Mussolini dare\nnot permit the people to resume normal living.\nThey must rattle the sabre to feed the discontent\nupon which their future is builded.—Concord Her\nald-Tribune. ^ r\nIT S \"REALISM\" ALL RIGHT FOR AUSTRIANS\nWhether the United States will recognize the\nunion of Austria and Germany, and recall our am\nbassador from Vienna, will depend, it is said, upon\nwhether this territorial change has been accom\nplished by armed intervention. If the Austrians\nagree to the union by vote in the approaching\nplebiscite. Uncle Sam will have to regard it as a\n\"voluntary\" union and \"recognize\" accordingly.\nAnd Herr Hitler, as The Statesville Daily says,\n\"is attending to that. When the Austrians go to\nthe polls to express themselves they will vote al\nmost as one for union with Germany, for to refuse\nwould mean another 'purge' that would leave\nbumph heads and economic isolatiqn. The election\nwill simply mean the same unanimity that was\nexpected for the plebiscite that was scheduled for\nlast Sunday, but it will be the other way around.\n\"This overrunning of Austria was encouraged by\nHitler's earlier successes in scrapping agreements.\nIt could have been avoided if France and England\nhad stood firm at the start: it could have been\navoided if there had been a 'thou shalt not* to Italy\nwhen Mussolini was about to rape Etfiiopia. The\nEuropean democracies see thut now—Lbut it is too\nlate. And thus England's Mr. Chamberlain is see\ning his 'reahsm' for just what it is.\"—Concord\nTimes.\nAnent this indicated reduction in gas rates, why\nnot extend it to iuclude congressional pay?\nPERHAPS\n-1 Ati' G£NTl£Mcn^\n^p&tUHGTON WOfi/PEf?\n&#^THeJ!L°C\ninOfOOT PAM ~ p\nrne very eorroM or /?\nseeth/zvc tt?A/r/fVm?s~y\nAHP COME OP W/j-//\ntyCTS /<v f//$~ y\n+\nLIFE DAY BY DAY\n- By W1CKES WAMBOLDT _\nJ Every now and then we hear\nsome person say that he is going'\ni to do this or that pleasant thin#\nwhen his \"ship comes in.\" But\nhas he sent a\nship out'.'

Mitchell notilied\nCounty FSA Supervisor hdgai H.\nAnderson, Greensboro, late to\nday, to authorize Mr. JeR8UP\naccept the option on the taim he\nexpects to buy.\nA committee of three Guilxoid\nfarmers previously had picked\nJessup as one they considered (\nable to make a go of the undet\ntaking. '\nJessup, who is not only the lust\nNorth Carolinian approved for a\nland purchase loan, but also the\nfirst in the five states of this re\ngion, will receive a check when\nthe land title is cleared. The loan\nis for $4475, of which $1100 is\nfor repairs and the remainder to\nbuy the 98-acre farm upon which\nMr. and Mrs. Jessup and four\nsons and one daughter have lived\nas tenants for the past two years.\nThe family will have 40 years in\nwhich to repay the loan at 3 per\ncent interest. The borrower\nagrees to follow good farming\npractices and the loan is based\nupon sound plans figured on the\nearning capacity of the farmer\nand his farm. A variable payment\nplan wil lenable Mr. Jessup to\nmake heavier payments in good\nyears and lighter payments in\nbad crop years.\nThe farm Mr. Jessup is buying\nift 17 miles southeast of Greens\nboro, on the Kimesville road. It\nis known as the Jim Neese farm\nand is being bought from Rush\nSmith of High Point, an absentee\nowner. . I\nThe purchase of this farm ac\ntually amounts to Mr. Jesup's sec\nond step toward ownership, re\ngional officials stated. He took a\nfirst «tep two years ago when un\nder tne rural rehabilitation pro\ngram of the FSA he received a\nloan which helped him to shift\nfrom \"cropper\" to managing ten\n| ant. with stock and tools of his\n! own.\nj Mr. Jessup was born and renr-j\nI ed on a Surry county farm, near\nPilot mountain. After leaving his\nfather's farm he spent most of\nhis life as a sharecropper, moving\n• from one farm to another each\nyear, until he moved two years\n! airo to the farm which he is now\nbuying. Under the supervised re\nI habilitation loan program, he was)\nj able to buy his own workstock\n! and equipment and become a\ni managing tenant. Since he came\non the rehabilitation program, the\ncounty supervisor's records show\nthat he has increased his net\nworth, or worldly goods in excess\nof debt, from $370 to $070; and\nhis cash income has gone up from\n; $521 for 11)30 to $855 for 1937,\nnot including a favorable increase\nin food and feed crops for homo\nI use.\n! The farm and home plan which\nthe county supervisors helped the\nJessups to work out provides for\n! food for the family, feed for\nI stock, winter cover crops, les\n! pedeza and peas for soil improve\n[ ment, as wel las tobacco and truck\ncrops for sale. The farm has 04\nacres in forest and pasture and 34\nacres in crops.\nTHIEVES LIKE GUM\n1 1-ORAN, 0.

Y. Floyd, AAA administra\ntor at State college.\nTriple-A figures show that while\nwholesale prices for agricultural\nproducts decreased in recent\nmonths and are now some 25 per\ncent lower than they were twelve\nmonths ago, pi-ices for many in\ndustrial products are higher than\nthey were early last year.\nFarmers are being hit both\nways by this change, Floyd point\ned out. They must sell what they\ngrow at lowered prices and buy\nmanufactured goods at prices dif\nfering little from those of early\n1D37.\nFor instanoe, he said, farm\nprices were 22 per cent lower in\nMarch, 19.*18 relative to the price\nof products farmers buy than a\nyear earlier.\nAgriculture and industry moved\ntogether in their recovery from\nthe low prices of 1932-33 until\nearly in 19.17. However, in only\none month, January, 1937, were\nfarm prices as high relative to\nprices paid for goods farmers buy\na.s they were during the 1910-14\nQpriod.\nMeats that would have cost\nwholesale $1 in 1929 sold for 83\ncents on January 30, 1937, and\nori March 12, 1938, sold for 75\ncents.\niietween January 30, 1937, and\nMarch 12 of this year, wholesale\nprices for specified farm prod\nucts, taking the 1929 dollar as a\nbase, declined as follows: fruits\nand vegetables, from 89 cents to\n57 cents; dairy products, from 84\ncents to 73 cents; miscellaneous\nfoods, from 8G cents to 7L cents;\nlivestock and poultry, from H5\ncents to 79 cents; and miscellane\nous farm products, from 80 cents\nto (JO cents.\nFOUR CASES BEFORE\nMAYOR'S COURT\nA number of cases were heard\nin city court this morning before\nMayor A.

IS SUGGESTED\nBennett Says Without Pro\ntection, All Soil Would\nBe Lost in 50 Years\nBy D. W. BENNETT\nAoiatani County Agent\nThe continued prosperity of any\nj country is dependent upon its ac\ni riculture, and agriculture in turn\n{is dependent upon the richness of\nI its soil. For {fenerations our fore\nI lathers have carelessly let the top\nsix inches of mother earth wash\naway. Unless the generation of to\nday is awakened to the importance\nof taking care of the soil, our\nprosperity will begin to diminish.\nSome of our steep hillsides are\nwashing away at the rate of one\ninch every seven years. At this\n; rate our top seven inches of soil\n1 will be lost in fifty years.\nThese appalling facts bring the\nquestion to our minds us to how\nwe may stop Jthe ravages of soil\ni erosion. First, we should consider\n, proper land use which will call for\na good crop rotation with plenty\nI of leguminous cover crops. Sec\nond, plant our steepest slopes in\nforest seedlings. Third, strip crop\nthe steepest cultivated hillsides\nwith close growing cover crops.\nFourth, terrace our more gentle\nhillsides. Fifth, plant winter cover\ncrops to increase the humous in\nthe soil and protect t'ie land from\n! erosion during the winter. Sixth,\nplant locusts in the gullies, and\nput in Ion- check dams.\nI If the above practices were car\nried out, erosion would be cut to\nla minimum; soil fertility would be\nincreased; farm income would be\n(increased; less acres would be in\ncultivation, thereby giving more\ntime for recreation; and the con\ntinued prosperity of our country\nj would be assured.\nMISSION CIRCLE AT\nSTAR BETHEL WILL\nKEEP ANNIVERSARY\nMembers of the various church\nes and the general public are in\nvjU'd lq attend the 21st anniver\n| sary of the Mission circle of the\nj Star of Uethel Baptist church\n| (colored) on April 20, it was an\nnounced today.\nRev.

Will he curat\nback, she wonders? *\nCHAPTER XXVI\nThe war was not over before\nChristmas. Nor before tftc spring\ncame. It grew fiercer ami named\ninland alone the frontiers. On\nsea the fighting approached the\nfantistic. Almost without a navy\nthe United States was holding hei\nown, doing it by means of a few\nwell-managed war sloops (you\nmight count them on your fin\ngers) and those little privateers\nthat were pourim* out ot' every\nAmerican port to sting the proud\nBritish Navy like a swarm of\nwasps.\nOn the day that Polly's son was\nboru in her father's house in Con\nnecticut. the clipper Gray Gull\nwa.s having a reckless try at an\narmed British merchantman al\nmost twice her size.\nThe Gull was not without ex\nperience. Several times during\nthe winter she had intercepted\nWest Indian men coming up from\nJamaica and had crippled them\nconsiderably; but always other\nships in the English convey had\ndriven off the fragile clipper be\nfore she could take her prize.\nThe question of money bceanu\nacute to the Gull's officers. Tin\nunpaid crew was loyal, cheerfully\nforegoing pay; but the matter ol\nprocuring food for 75 hearty men\nwas a problem that kept Cabel\nand Jerry awake and scheming\nthrough many a night when thej\nshould have bee nslceping.\n\"I'd not have expected mj\nfather to be so pig-headed about\nthis.\" Cabell said.\nSoon after getting his letter ol\nmarque from President Madison\nhe had asked his father for\nwith which to finance his cruise\nHe asked it by land post fron\nA\\ ilmington, since Hoston was in\naccessible by water at the time\nThe letter that came in answei\nwas violent anil scathing.\n\"You exceeded yourself wlicr\nyou bought the clipper on my au\nthority. I will pay for it since th«\ndebt is made, but 1 will not sub\nskjize it nor give you anothei\nt>hip if you lose that one. I d<\nnot hold with Mr. Madison's wai\nand I wish to keep out of it.\n(insist that my son keep out of it.\nThose insults we have had from\ni Kngland had better be ignored\nthan fought over . .\nCabell had replied by request\ning his lather's lawyer to send\nhim at once a small inheritance\nhe had had from a relative's es\n• tate \"since I am of age and the\nmoney is mine.\" This amount\nt was transferred to him at a Wil\nmington bank and it was now al\n| most spent.\n$ c. <■\nit was during their stop at Wil\nmington that Jerry and Cabell\nhad the recipe for taking a Brit\nish merchantman which they were\nnow about to put into practice:\n\"You cut out your ship after\ndark.\" a reckless young Carolin\nian told them. \"Don't attack the\n(first bii^r you see. She's apt to\n; be the lookout. Wait fo ra strag-j\ngler. When you've picked yourl\n! laggard, sail round her aJid cut\nj her from the pack. Then take\nher.\" There followed advice more\nexplicit from the young man who\nsailed a Baltimore clipper as light\na sthe (lull and who was not trou\nbled with New England caution.\nHe had already taken four prizes,\nhe said. ami had divided the spoils\namong a gratified crew.\nThat May day when Polly's son\nwas crying his first cries, the\nCray (lull was cruising off the J\ncoast of Northern France, boldly:\nattempting to spy out a convoy of\nhome-coming merchantmen from\nforeign waters.\nToward evening a fleet was!\nspied by the lookouts. At this\nnews Jerry climbed the ratlines to\nsee ho winany sail theer were and\n, I how well protected. He climbed\nI down to confer with Cabell. He\nhad counted more than a score,\"\nhe said, with what appeared to be\n• two men-of-war convoying the\nfleet. j\ni They decided to wear ship and\nsail west to avoid being detected.\n\"We're not worth chasing,\" Jerry\n• pointed out, \"but if they see us\nfollowing, one of the frigates will\ni rake us. Do you agree?\" i\nCabell did and ordered the man '\n• at the wheel to port helm. They\nput out into the Atlantic, deter\n• mined to withdraw from sigh as if\n» making westward passage.\nA feeling of elation seized them\n;1 all. Not a man among them but\nwished for action and a streak of\nluck. So far, the Gray Gull had\nnut justified her letter ot marque\nas a privateer. If she had stung\nthe English navy, it. was as a ner\nvous gnat rather than as an angry\nhornet.\nThe test had arrived. v\\ hen\ndark was falling the Gray Gullsj\ncrew brought her cast, northeast, |\nwith all lights doused, in toward i\nthe rich prizes that were nearing\nthe sea girt island called England.\nBristol would be the fleet's desti\nnation, for it had passed Land s\nEnd and showed nu intention ol.\nentering the Channel. 1 his much\nwas to the Gray Gull's advantage.\nI\nAnd how luck came at last. The\nhindmost ship was lagging. From\nher lanterns, fore and aft and\nquarterdeck, they could judge hex\nsize. A large merchant ship, about\n;>0U tons, tal lsparred, three mast\ned and square sailed.\nThe Gray Gull, with Jerry at\nthe helm, came up on her slowly\nand sliently, sailed to larboard ol\nher for a time, passed her and all\nbut crossed her bows; wore ship\nand crossed her stern, then came\nup to starboard. Looking up, they\ncould see that she was lightly\nmanned and that those who sailed\nher were celebrating some event\nin the cup that cheers.\nJerry conferred with Cabell. He\nsaid, \"I'll take her without firing\na round if you'll give me a dozen\nmen.\"\n\"We'll have to fire, of course.\nJust the carronades. A few rounds\nand she's ours. We'll have her\nbefore they can man the guns.\nWo'll board her and run her off\nin record time.\" It was the\nmethod of the young Carolinian,\napplicable here to perfection.\n.But Jerry shook his head in\nviolent negation. \"You'd ruin her\nrigging at best. She's got sweet\nrigging\"' — his gaze lifted to\nwhere tall masts piorced the\nblackness. \"At worst you'd bring\nthe frigates down on us. No fir\ning. I tell you!\"\n\"How'll you do it?\" Cabell\nhissed. \"By tosing seaweed?\" The\ntenseness of the situation made\nhim feel a lurious impatience with\nhis obstinate first mate. He would\nhave liked, actually, to wring his\nneck. . . . Jerry was feeling the\nsame urge in regard to his cap\ntain. Perhaps the inevitable mo\nment had come when one ship was\ntoo small for two such dominating\npersonalities.\n\"Give me 12 men and a long\nboat,\" Jerry said again, \"and I'll\ntake her. I'll board her bv\nstealth.\"\nSEE MEXICAN\nRIGHT TREND\nImpartial Observers Be\nlieve Revolutionary Habit\nIs Abandoned\nBr WILLIAM H. LANDER I\nUnited Press Staff Correspondent\nMEXICO, I>.

It was fantas-;\ntic to be sailing beside the bi^\nI shi pin the darkness, just out of j\n1 range of her lantern rays, unseen\nI and unsuspected. Now and again\nthe Gray Gull's sailors would take\nin more of her sail to keep pace\nwith the laggard. The British ship\nwas being so badly handled that i\nher sailors were scarcely getting\neight knots out of her.\nJerry said, \"Give me my chance, j\nCabell! 1 want a ship of my own.\ni'll even it up by giving you most\nof her cargo. Give me 12 of your\nmen. That'll leave you 60, and\nmore. Bill Gill can replace me as\nI mate. He's as {rood a seaman,\nany way you take him.\"\n\"Rate!\" exclaimed Cabell. He\nJ was referinjr to the last remark.\n| \"Nobody could replace you.\" But\n| he put out his hand and gripped\nj Jerry's. \"Take the best of the\nj long boats,\" lie said, \"and pick\nI your men. . . . But God help you. j\nII doubt if Polly would thank me\n, for this.\"\nAt that moment Polly was an\nI unreal dream to Jerry Whitfield.

Mark\nWilcox (1)., Fla.) who was badly\ndefeated by Senator Claude Pep\nper (1)., Fla.) in the recent Flor\nida primary, proposed that WPA\nfunds be denied to anyone engag\ning in federal, state or municipal\npolitical campaigns. The amend\nment lost. 110 to 79.\nHep. Rruce Barton (R., X. V.)\noffered an amendment to impose\nfines of $5,000 and prison terms\nof five years on persons found\nguilty of using WPA money for\npolitical purposes. It was reject\ned NT to 4K. An amendment by\nRep. Alfred X. Phillips. Jr., (I).,\nConn.) however which would have\neliminated the meager prohibitions\nagainst playing polictics with\nmoney, now in the bill was over\nwhelmingly defeated. 01'2 to 1'!.\nI lL„ ,,M_\npripriates 5-1,2 >0.000.000 to con\ntinue WPA relief until February\n1, 1030; $065,000,000 for WPA\nprojects and authorizes continua\ntion of the $500,000,000 PWA re\nvolving fund; $75,000,000 for the\nNational Youth Administration;\n$175,000,000 for the Farm Secur\nity Administration; $250,000 for\nthe National Emergency Council\nand a similar amount for the Na\ntion Resources Committee; $120.\n000 for the Prison Industries Ad\nministration $10,555,000 for the\nTreasurv and Department of Com\nmerce; $100,000,000 for the Ru\nral Electrification Administration\nand other routine administrative\nallocations.\nThe fund is the heart of the\npresident's new anti-depression\ndrive which also will embrace au\nthority to the RFC to loan £U,\n\">00,000,000 to big and little busi\nness; $187,000,000 for mainten\nance of Civilian Conservation\nCorps camps at their present\nstrength; $37,000,000 for flood\ncontrol, and between $300,000,\n000 and $500,000,000 for housing\nprojects.\nThe total will exceed $5,000,\n000.000 and will set a new peace\ntime appropriations record of\n$11,000,000,000 for one session\nof congress. This staggering sum\nwas used by Republicans as a\nspringboard for attacks which\ncrumpled under the barrage of\n\"aye\" votes from the heavy Dem\nocrat it- majority.\nThe same apathy shown by Re\npublicans and Democrats alike\nduring general debatj on the bill\nwas displayed when :t was thrown\nopen to amendment. The thump\ning 10(5 to 30 defeat of the\namendment by Rep. Robert L. I5a\ncon (R., N. Y.) to return admin\nistration of relief to the states,\nconvinced Republicans of the\nhopelessness of their fight to re\n\\ isc spending downward and many\ndiscouraged', left the chamber.

Campbell Morgan.\nA NEWSPAPER office yields\nROMANCE\n(By BRUCE CATTON)\nA great deal of riohs^iJse has been print\ned at one time or another about the ro\nmance of newspaper work. From the time\nof Richard Harding Davis down to the tfra\not \"The Front Page,\" the newspaperman\nhas been held up as a chap who moves\nfhroujrh an aura of romance—a slightly\nsmudged and soiled aura, occasionally, but\nRomance uonetheless. . ; . v\nAt least 90 per cent of this is pure ho\nkum. Yet there is a romance in the busi\nness, as there is in all trades and callings;\nbut there is nothing spectacular about it,\nand it is only rarely that the man in the\nstreet is able to get a Jook at it.\ni One of these rare occasions took place\nbot long ago when the Pulitzer Prizes for\n!he past year were awarded.\nThe gold medal for disinterested and\nmeritorious public service was awarded to\nhe Bismarck Tribune, in North Dakota;\nmd because the thing which that news\npaper did to win the award is a striking\npxample o£ the teal romance of newspaper\nivork, the tals is worth retelling here.\nBack in 1933 the farming region of\nwestern North Dakota was in a bad way.\nDrought and economic depression had re\nWed whole areas to desperation. About\n)he only solution anyone could offer was a\nsuggestion that all hands stand by and\n^ait for help from Washington.\n1 It was here that the Bismarck Tribune\n^ot busy. The late George D. Mann, pub\nlisher of the newspaper, had the notion\nlhat the farmers of this particular dust\nbowl could work their own way out of the\njness if someone showed them how. He\niecided that his paper would do the show\ning.\n' So a long, unspectacular and laborious\n[•ampaign was begun. First, the newspa\nper stressed the value of irrigation. It agi\ntated, campaigned and educated; and, af\n$cr some three years, brought about the\nConstruction of some 200 irrigation proj\nects which helped turn sun-baked fields\ninto greeh and fertile producers again.\n1 But Lhat was only a part of it.\nJ There was a campaign to restore sub\ntnarginal lands to the range; a drive for\nihe construction of innumerable small\nHams to conserve water; a shelter-belt pro\n!ram; a course of education :m scientific\narming practices such as contour plowing\nind crop diversification, and a whole flock\nAf lesser matters.\n• as a result ot all ot this, the area which\nRooked done for a few years ago is now\nSetting back on its feet agaiu—and, which\nfc important* getting there by its own ef\nforts, and not by help from above.\nNow there is a genuine specimen of the\n'/romance\" of the newspaper business. It\nisn't the sort of romance you read about.\nThere are no picturesque reporters in it,\nhard-boiled editors, i*o dountless seek\ners after scoops. It is simply a story of a\nlong, thankless campaign to make a region\nk better place to live in; as such, it is worth\na dozen of the old b1ood-and-thunder, get\nthe-news-ai-all-costs yarns,\ni\n1 The 7.00 is going to trade ah emu\nfor ar aoudad, and local reporters have\nalready gone into training with spelling\nhooks for the great event.\n» The Smithsonian Institution has just re\nceived a whale. If they can't find a satis\nfactory w^y to keep it preserved it's going\njo be a Jomah.\n,\n» The ideal holder of public office has\nbeen found. He is the dog catcher of Cor\nJallis, Orfe^whd has just resigned aftei\nfinding there were no dogs to eatch. ^\nI* ' . - ^\nI .\nI NEWSPAPERS' OPINIONS\nI i ~ . i ■■ i i \" . ^ \" . ——J\nWOULD INCREASE FEDERAL POWER\nRepresentatives of more than fifty different in\n' dustries and of agriculture agreed at New Orlean:\ni that the federal wage-hour legislation before con\ngress should be opposed aggressively.\nThere was \"unanimous decision by the delegate:\nto continue opposition on the ground that the bill:\nnow before congress in reality were not wage bills\nbut rather were subterfuge measures designed t(\ngive the federal government arbitrary control ovei\nthe nation's industry and labor for political ex\njpediency.\" ' .\nIn the language of the chairman of the confer\nence, \"we are sitting on the edge of an earthquak<\nright now and action against the bill must bi\nJ prompt and vigorous.\" A large number of \"mar\n| ginal industries, which just now are struggling t<\n1 keep operating, would be put out of business\nthrowing thousands of workers out of jobs, if this\nlegislation is enacted.*1 In his opinion, of the 10,\nOOOsawmills in the South, \"at least 9,500 of them\ncould not operate under the federal wage-hour\nbills proposed.\"\nThe wage-hour bill is political. It is steeped in\n. the New Deal politics. It is without consideration\nfor the South. President Roosevelt virtually said\n'so in his letter from Charleston to Mrs. Norton,\n! member of congress. Pressure has been and i« be\ning put upon members of congress to vote as the\nI president wishes, not as their section needs. The\nspending policies authorized by congress give the\nI White House sweeping powers over the electorate\nj notwithstanding the claims that there is no politics\n! in grants, gifts and allotments.\n. If the wage-hour bill should become law. the\nSouth would be punished. It is nothing new to\n; penalize, the South. Its states have been treated as\n[ tributary provinces since Appomattox and they arc\ntreated as tributary provinces now. What care\npoliticians of the East and the Middle West about\n( conditions in Southern industry? Their selfish in\nterest is in the votes they attract to their candi\ndacies.\nThe efforts of the conference in New Orleans\nshould be supported over all the South. Senators\nand representatives should be made to understand\nthat their constituents arc opposed to this radical\nlegislation whereby the South would suffer. Pres\nsure from New Deal leaders should be combatted\nby pressure from the affected people. The South\nhas achieved its gains without benefit of govern\nment and in the face of Eastern opposition. The\nSouth is backward because the federal government\nhas pursued policies which have penalized the whole\nsection.—Charleston News and Courier.\nWOES OF THE FARM BILL\nThe recently enacted, and how operative federal\nfarm measure, started off with a huge bang but\nlike most farm benefit legislation it has already\nencountered some unhappy situations. Undoubted\nly there is considerable dissatisfaction among the\ncotton farmers of the South at the manner in\nwhich the act really is working out.\nBut it is perhaps from those hit hardest in the\noperation of the new law that least is heard. Land\nowners have been quick to voice their disapproval\nif adversely affected bv the law, despite the refer\nendum taken upon its application.\nBut from that voiceless class, the tenant farm\ners of the South, not much has been heard. Yet\nwe in Cleveland county are on,the verge of a bad\nsituation because of the adverse results of the act\nupon the tenant class. From the department of\nwelfare in Cleveland county, it has been learned\nthat tenant farmers, displaced from the land be\ncause of the farm act, are providing a constantly\ngrowing problem. They are forced from the land\nthey have cultivated heretofore because the farm\ning landowners say they cannot keep them under\ncurtailed crop acreage. These tenants have no\nwhere to go. What is true in Cleveland county, is\ntrue elsewhere in this region and is true through\nout the cotton belt. These tenants have been\nbrought up on the land. They know no other life.\nThey have no other training. They are not skilled\nnor arc they proficient in any other manner of\nliving.\nLittle blame can be attached to landowners who\noperate their owh farms for this condition. Cer-1\ntainly it is reasonable that if a farmer had a dozen\ntenant families on 150 or 200 acres qf cotton land\nlast, year, and his acreage is cut to 75 acres or\nbelow this year, he has not the need of all the\nlabor he used last year, Cotton production utilizes\nmore actual labor on tlio farms of this country\nperhaps than any other crop. With the reduction\nof the crop comes the natural curtailment of jabor.\nWhere are these people to go but to relief of\nfices? Certainly they should not be put on relief\nexcept as a last resort. But when there is no mar\nket fdr farm labor, that last resort is. reached.\nIt seems there is little else to do. There is little\nwonder through the complexities of legislation,\nthrough the operation of widely different laws de\nsigned to achieve widely separated ends, that the\nrelief rolls continue to grow ing America.—Shelby\nStar. \"\nBOOMS ARE BURSTING\nThe presidential boom for Jesse .Tones, R.

THE MATTER WITH THE SOUTH\n• • A special commission investigating economic\nconditions in various parts of the nation has made\nthe “startling” discovery and reported their find\nings to the President that the Southeast presents\nthe most difficult economic problems facing the\ncountry. The daily newspapers are featuring the\nfindings.\nThose who have the opportunity to travel,\nread or otherwise compare the various sections of\nthe United States will agree with the facts as pre\nsented to the President, altho some may disagree\nwith some of the recommendations made as to the\ncure.\nListed among the most important “discover\nies” are: too much population, too many tenant\nfarmers, too much emphasis on “money” crops\n(especially cotton), too few industries. With all\nof these facts, we can certainly agree.\nWhat to do about it is something else again\nbut it is to be hoped, by all who love the South and\nwould see its people prosper, that something is\ndone to solve these grave economic problems which\nthreaten a potentially rich portion of our nation.\nIt is to be hoped that this is just not another in\nvestigation which hits the front pages of the pa\npers for a few days and then is lost in the shuffle,\npigeon-holed until dusty and forgotten.\nIt should be interesting to those who claim\nthe South is taking all the industries from the East\nto know that the commission found still too few\nindustries in the South. Despite the clamor by the.\nNorth as to unfair competition in wages, based on\ncost of living, and the demand for no differential\nin wages so as to take away from the South its\nonly natural advantage, it is most interesting to\nnote the recommendation by the committee that\nmore and diversified industries might mean the\nsalvation of the South.\nMore emphasis should be given to the fact\nfound that the South waxes rich or starves on\n“money crops”. It is a good old axiom that: God\nhelps those who help themselves, and how can a\nfarmer expect to be a real and successful farmer\nwhen he fails to provide from the soil the very\nfood which his family needs. There should be less\nimportance placed on cotton, tobacco and peanuts,\nwhich in one season bring a fortune and in the\nnext bankruptcy; more importance should be given\nto truck farming, cattle raising, orchards, poultry,\netc. and no farmer should be given aid who does\nnot first provide the daily sustenance for his own\nfamily and store up these good things for the rainy\nday, the dry day and the day of the boll weevil and\nbumper tobacco crops.\n^ Most important fact found and reported to the\n[But It’s True\nSob\n• GUNS'NGt*\nAZ/ATOR SCRATCHEO\nHIS LAST HAMS /V\nSAHO BV ZOOM/H6\nDOH/AJ SO Close TO THIS\nEARTH THAT HIS LEFT\nW/H6 CUT 6POOZES OH\nTHE 8EACH—AT DAfTOHA,\nFLORIDA.

We\nhear lots about absentee ownership of industry but\nabsentee ownership of industry is a small skimp\ntion in the South when compared with absentee\nownership and management of the farms which\ncomprise our biggest business. This tenant system\nof servitude is allied with the fault found above by\nthe commission in that farm operators demand\nthat their tenants plant money crops. The big\nfarmers do not lack for the everyday things a\nfarmer should raise, as outlined above, but the\nhundreds of thousands of tenants are so pushed to\nmake a successful money crop that they have no\ntime to raise the extra things every farmer should\nraise. We hope the commission somehow can get\nthe connection between money crops and too many\ntenants. The solution is to make farmers out of\ntenants.\nWe have had sweeping investigations of big\nbusiness and we have had legislation restricting\nbig business and we have heard plenty of the\nabuses made by big business, but, in our estima\ntion, if the government would make the same kind\nof sweeping investigation of the Farm-tenant plan\nin the South, the abuses found would make big\nbusiness look like a bunch of saints.\nFinally we come to another important point!\nmade by the fact-finding body: too many people in\nthe South for what we have to offer and too big a\nbirth rate to make matters worse in the future.\nTime was when a man raised a big family and he\nwas usually motivated by the profit urge. If he\nwere a farmer, he needed boys to use instead of\nhired help and girls to help mother with the house\nwork, the canning, gardening, etc. If he were a\nmill employee and had a good job it was possible\nfor him to raise a big family and get them all jobs,\npaychecks of which were all turned over to papa.\nBut times have changed and under this new order,\nboys and girls are leaving the farms and hard\ntimes makes it necessary for industry to employ\nonly the heads of families. The opportunity to\nwork is fast fading for the young under this ma\nchine age.\nThe only answer to that problem is birth con\ntrol. Practised in the large cities because of the\nextreme high cost of living and thruout other sec\ntions thru education and a changing economic sys\ntem, it has been tabooed in the South and education\nof the people, especially the colored race, has been\nsadly neglected along such lines because of fear\non the part of teachers of an uprising against their\ntoo-modern ideas. There are only two answers to\na question of too many people: 1. Abstinence, and\n2. Control. To help solve the problem, one may\ntake his choice.\nROBBERY IS A CRIME\n(Editorial from this Wednesday’s\nNews & Observer, reprinted\nwithout comment)\nRivers Johnson of Duplin, an\nnouncing his determination to con\ntest the second primary vote in\nwhich he appeared to have narrow\nly trailed J. Abner Barker of Samp\nson for solicitor in the Sixth Ju\ndiical District, is quoted as having\nsaid that if the returns had shown\na decisive margin for his opponent\nhe \"would have been a good Demo\ncrat and a good sport,” submitting\nto the result in spite of evidence\nof irregularities.\nHappily, our election system isn t\na matter of sportsmanship. Even\nif it were, there is no rule of\nsportsmanship which requires a\ncontestant in any competition to\nsubmit to fraud or to ignore the\nevidence of it.\nIn fact, the fraud committed un\nder election irregularities that dis\ntort the will of the voters, that\nsubstitute a fake for an honest\nshowing of their faith, is not so\nmuch a crime against the candi\ndate and his aspirations as it is\na crime against the people whose\nvotes are stolen.\nAnd it is a crime, the most in\nsidious crime that can be commit\nted against organized society in\npeace times. The sooner it is so\nrecognized and dealt with as the\nvicious, cancerous thing it is, the\nbetter it will be for the future of\nthe Democratic party and for the\nState, both of which must depend\nfor continuity and stability upon\nthe confidence of the people in\ntheir essential decency and integri\nty.\nUnfortunately, time was when a\nspecious Democratic doctrine held\ntoo firmly that if a candidate were\nbeaten within the party, no matter\nhow he were beaten, he should take\nhis licking without whining. The\npolitically experienced will tell you\nthat he was tricked out of a nom\nination he fairly won and thereaft\ner considered that passive submis\nsion to fraud was a better part of\nparty regularity.\nIn North Carolina, the Democrat\nic party is buttressed by a record\ntoo full of the factual evidences of\ngood government, a record covering\ntoo long and too firm a hold on the\nconfidence of the people to have to\nimpose such a price for the loyalty\nit must have to live.\nwe are told occasionally that\nparty labels are less securely fixed\non Democrats now than they used\nto be. If there is anything calcu\nlated to strain old loyalties to the\nripping point, it is the realization\nthat manipulation of the party’s\nmachinery for self-expression has\nturned the virtue of self-expression\ninto a stupid and a futile farce.\nIf Mr. Johnson has reasonable\ngrounds to believe that in the re\ncent primary a major crime was\ncommitted against him and the\npeople he believes wanted him as\none of their chosen officials, ac\nquiescence now would disqualify\nhim for the high law enforcement\noffice he seeks. If he should fail\nto use every honorable means to\nestablish, under the law, the truth\nor the falsity of the charges he\nwould not be fit for the office of\nsolicitor of his district.\nRINGWOOD\nA large crowd gathened at the\nEpiscopal Church on Wednesday\nevening at 8:00 to see the wedding\nof Miss Mildred Louise Aycock, of\nRingwood, to Mr. Marvin Mitchell\nHardee of Warrenton.\nFriends and relatives are glad to\nknow that Miss Clyde Chichester is\nimproving after many weeks of ill\nnes.\nMiss Martha Blanche Rice spent\nthe week with Mrs. Edward Tip\npette. y\nFriends of the community all join\nin sympathy with the family 0f\nMrs. Cary Williams Sr., who is very\nill, and hope she will soon be on\nher way to recovery.\nMessrs.

By MIGHT C.MOORE\nSunday School Lesson for\nMarch 27.\nScripture: Mark 7:1-1.\"5.\nGolden Text: Thus people hon\noureth me with their lips, l»ut\ntheir heart is far from me.—\nMark 7: (>.\nCertain of the ecclesiastical au\nthorities from Jerusalem had\ncome to Galilee and were on the\ntrack of Jesus seeking: to entrap\nhim in his teaching, to discredit\nhis work, and to counteract his\ninfluence. On the traditions of the\nelders they based their charge\nthat the disciples, contrary to\ncustom, were eating with unwash\nen hands, But Jesus brushed aside\nthe tilm of ceremonialism and re\nvealed to them the unworldly na\nture of the kingdom of God.\nRELIGION OBSCURED BY\nCEREMONIALISM\n(Mark 7: 1-4)\nTHE CUSTOM of the Jews\nI showed how religion may be ob\nscured by ceremonialism. Anions\nthe Jews it was the custom never\nto cat with unwashen hands. The\nhabit was based less upon sani\n. tary reasons, though the Oriental\nate with his lingers, than upon\nectcmonial grounds, for a system\nof minute and exact purifications\n! enslaved the people in every\nmovement of their daily lives. So\nthe orthodox Jew would not eat\nunless he had ceremonially wash\ned his hands; and this washing\n, even extended to the Clips and\ni pots, the brazen Vessels and the\ni tables.\nRELIGION OPPOSED IJY\nCRITICISM\nI (Mark 7: 5)\nTHE QUESTION of the Phari\nsees showed how religion may be\nopposed by criticism. It so hap\npened that the Scribes from Je\nrusalem saw some of the disciples\npartaking of a meal with hands\nnot ceremonially purified as tra\ndition demanded. At once they\nfound fault and they raised the\nquery, asking Jesus direct: \"Why\nwalk not thy disciples according\nto the traditions of the elders,\nbut eat their bread with defiled\nPalm Beach county estimated that\nin only tour months at least 25\npersons were saved from drown\ning in roadside canais by the\nprogram that has been worked\nout.\nWhile the effectiveness or tne\nAustralian pine bar rier cannot be\nchecked positively, it was pointed\nout by traffic and highway offi\ncers that almost daily trees an*\ndamaged or destroyed by automo\nbiles — indicating: that if the\ntrees had not been there the cars\nmight have gone jnto canal*.\nThe cost of replacing the dam\naged trees is comparatively slight,\nofficials said.\n| hands?\" It was not that they car\nlo d so much for the ceremony of\n! cleanliness and still l»ss that they\nwished to reclaim tne disciples\nfrom th»*ir supposed wayward\nness. It .was, rather, a thrust at\nJesus and a subtle attempt to dis\ncredit him in the eyes of the tra\ndition-bound people.\nRELIGION OUTRAGED BY\nCONDUCT\n(Mark 7: G-13)\nTHE COMMENT of Jesus show\ned how religion may be outraged\nby conduct. In reply to the scribes\nJesus first quoted an apt asser\ntion from Isaiah: \"This people\nhonoroth me with their lips, but\ntheir heart is far from me.\" Spir\nituality had been displaced by\nformality. And at the bottom of\nthis defection was the promulga\ntion of false doctrine, namely, the\nteaching of the commandments of\nmen instead of the doctrines of\nGod. They laid aside the divine\ncommandment and put in its place\nthe traditions of men as illustrat\ned in their minute and multiplied\nceremonial ablutions. Truly arid\nstrongly he turned upon his crit\nics with the declaration: \"F'nll\nwell do ye reject the command\nment of God, that ye keep your\ntradition.\" Then Jesus follows the\nquotation with an illustration and\nits application, lie takes the fifth\ncommandment as an example. Mo\nses commanded, \"Honor thy fa\nther and thy mother,\" and the\npenalty of disobedience was\ndeath. Rut these critics had soi\ncovered up the original command ;\nwith the commandments of men\nthat they had actually nullified\nthe ancient and ever-binding law.\nThey taught that if a son wished\nto escape the duty of parental\nsupport he could merely label his\nproperty as \"Corban,\" that is,\na gift of God; but he could keep\nthe property as long as he would\nand use it for whatever he chose\nexcept the one thing of support\ning his parents. It was a most\nshocking and perverse equivoca\ntion performed in the very name\nof God, whose primal law was\nthereby trampled under foot.\nThus the hypocrites were, as\nJesus said, guilty of \"making void\nthe word of God by your tradi\ntion, which we have delivered:\nand many such like things ye do.\"\nThese critics were thus shown to\nbe quibblers of the Jmost childish\nsort.\n— - - rnnr t r\\ n n«r\nitt-N rtnu\nIDEA IN RELIGION\n(1) The Right Idea in Atti\ntude. 'The l'harisees-—certain of\nthe scribes — some of his dis\nciples.\" Christ was in his world.\nTheir relation to him was a mat\nter of attitude first of all.

Some stood aloof from him. |\nm abviaiizen/=\n=U: shoes \"\nsniffle 1\nm nn\nat SW®1\nTypical of the new Spring Naturaliter designs\nis this smart new pattern... when you try it on\nand see its flattering lines you will recogniae it\na* the shoe for which you have been looking.\nHan't tpiai yaut lift\n'ivo fret fram haffMeaa' A, A\n**ttnaturalizes rnmrt\n$6.75\nPATTERSON'S\nNext Door to McLellan's\nSonic ' bitterly niticized him.\nEverything depended upon what\nthey thought of him.\n(2) The Right Idea in Aim.\n\"Had come—had seen.\" The dele\ngation from Jerusalem came u\ngood distance. Hut their purpose\nwas not sincere. Their object was\nsinister. Hence, their vision was\nblurred and refracted. They saw,\nbut could not see straight.\n(.'I) The Right Idea in Action. I\n\"His disciples ate their bread with\n—unwushen hands—the Jews, ex\ncept they wash their hands dili\ngently, eat not.\" It was not a\nquestion of sanitation, but cere\nmonialism. The Jews were bound\nby tradition. But the disciples had\nbeen liberated from the tetters\nof formalism. Sincerely surpasses\nformality.\nf4) The Kijrht Idea in Inquiry.\n\"The Pharisees and the scribes i\nask him.\" They were inquirers\nwho did not wish to know the\ntruth. They were quibblers who\nwanted to entangle Jesus in his\ntalk. Their question was tinged\nwith scorn. Hut who can learn j\nthe truth unless be seeks it with\na whole heart?\n(5) The Right Idea in Speech. 1\n\"This people honoreth me with •\ntheir lipp.\" They could speak i\nbeautiful words. They could^ sub- j\nscribe to lovely sentiments. Their i\nvoices, however, were like the 1\nclanging cymbal. '1 here was about\nthem the hollowness of hypocrisy.\nl.et no word be hypocritical.\n(0) The Right Idea in Spirit.\n\"Their heart is far from me.\"\nThis is tin* one supreme thing in\nour lesson both .to God and to\nmen. When the heart is distant\nand cold, nothing els« can be ac\nceptable. \"Son, give me thy\nheart.\" Then the consecrated J\nheart will go into everything we :\nthink or say or do. j\n(7) The Right Idea in Worship.;\n\"In vain do they worship me.\" i\nTbe exercises may have been or\nnate. The forms may have been\ncorrect. External commands may\nhave been carried out. Hut the1\nspirit of worship was lacking, j\nHence, it was vain. To worship\nGod at all, we must worship him\nin spirit and in truth.\n(X) The Right Idea in Observ\nance.—\"The commandment of God\nthe tradition of the elders.\" Ot\ncourse, it is wrong to substitute\nhuman tradition for divine com\nmand. But we may even obey\ndivine command without putting\nheart into it. Therefore, sincerity\nis required In even the forms ot\nreligion or they become mockery\nin the sight of God.\n(9) The Right Idea in Doctrine.\n\"Teaching as their doctrines the\nprecepts of men.\"4 Our beliefs\nprofoundly react upon our char\nacter and conduct. We never be- ,\nlieve wrong and do right. Happily\nwe can believe right and live ac\ncordingly. But sincerity will be\nrequired. #\n(10) The Right Idea in Obe\ndience. \"Moses said—but ye say\n—making void the word of God\nby your tradition.\" In other j\nwords, their obedience was not\nobedience. In seeming compliance\nwith the word of the law they ut\nterly destroyed its spirit. Such\nobedience is actual disobedience. 1\nIt lacks heart power. It is insin\ncere.\nI PILOT VIEW °|\n0 0\nPILOT VIEW, Mar. 24.—Mrs.\nHattie Pace of North Blue Ridge\nspent the* past week hero with her\nmother, Mrs. Sum Scafscy.\nRosco Stepp and Gene Justice\nof Kast Flat Rock were visitors\nin this section Sunday.\nBill Wells visited at the home\nof Mr. and Mrs. Frank Young of\nUnion IIill Sunday night.\nMrs. Pud Lvdav and Mr. and\nMrs. Richard Lyda of Fruitland\nspent Sunday afternoon here with\nMr. and Mrs. Andy Stepp.\nMrs. Bob Jones and children i\nspent Monday afternoon with Mr.\nand Mrs. Sam Searsey.\nJames Younjr of East Blue;\nRidge and Miss Willie Johnson\nwere supper guests of Mr: and\nMrs. Blaine Stepp Sunday night.\nMiss Carrie Lee Ruff, who has i\nhad the measles, is able to return\nto school.\nJ.

BANNISTER, Reporter\nEntered at the Postoffice at Marion,\nN. C., as second class matter.\nSUBSCRIPTION RATES:\nOne Year $1.50\nEix Months .75\nStrictly in Advance.\nMARION, N. C., AUGUST 10, 1939\nPEOPLE DEMAND IMPROVEM'T\nThe year 1929 is generally consid\nered to have been one of great pros\nperity for the United States. The\nten years which have elapsed since\nthe \"boom\" have been filled with\ntrying experiences for the American\npeople, who have had their ups and\ndowns.\nOf course, if one uses some statis\ntics, it looks like the business of the\nnation has improved considerably.\nFor example, our gold stocks have\nenormously increased, the consump\ntion of gasoline is up about fifty\nper cent, the number of automobiles\nin use is up about twenty-five per\ncent, and the consumption of elec\ntricity has increased about one\nfourth during the decade. The num\nber of automobile trucks in service is\nnow about twenty-five per cent\ngreater than in 1929.\nUsing other statistics, it appears\nthat the trend has been entirely\ndownward. For example, construc\ntion is down -about fifty per cent,\nexports of cotton down about the\nsame percentage, rail carloadings\nare off close to forty per cent, and\nwhile the population has gained\nabout nine million persons, the num\nber of employed has dropped more\nthan three millions.\nThe constrast of such figures is\nenough to confuse the average indi\nvidual. Nevertheless, basically, the\nUnited States possesses the wealth\nnecessary to provide adequate living\nstandards for every American citi\nzen. While we do not, as yet, thor\noughly understand the reasons which\nlie behind the scarcity amid plenty,\nthere are indications that the people\nare beginning to believe that reason\nprosperity is possible for every\nbody. I\nPoliticians and statesmen may de-1\nbate cause and effect ,but the peo\nple are interested in securing an\nimproved standard of living. This\ndesire, which some may consider\nselfish, outranks technical questions\nabout governmental forms and out\nweighs devotion to ancient chibbo\nleths. What the people of the nation\nas well as the world, demand today\nis greater opportunity to enjoy bet\nter living. The government that rec\nognizes this fact and meets the de\nmand will be the government that\nendures. Statesmen who ignore it will\neventually join the ranks of the un\nemployed. & «\nBETTER FARM HOUSES\n/\nLiveable farm houses can be built\nin the South for less than $1,400\nand in. the North for less than $2,\n500, according to Dr. W. W. Alex\nander, of the Farm Security Admin\nistration, which built 2,784 farm\nhouses last year.\nThese figures are authenticated\nby costs of construction in various\neections of the nation. They seem to\nindicate that there is not much ex\ncuse for unsightly farm homes and\ndisreputable dwellings for tenant\nfarmers anywhere in the United\nStates.\nWhile McDowell county is prob\nably no worse than other counties in\nthis respect it is apparent that there\nare farm homes in this section that\nreflect little credit upon either own\ner or landlord or tenants. It is time\nsomething is done about the prob\nlem of adequate housing for agricul\ntural residents and the experience\nof the Farm Security Administra\ntion may point the way.\nMARION PROGRESS\nCongratulations to our neighbor,\nthe Marion Progress which last week\ncelebrated its forty-third birthday.\nThis excellent paper has served Mar\nion and McDowell county well. It\nhas always stood for right and prog\nress. It has enjoyed strong support\nfrom the citizens of McDowell county\nand the merchants of Marion.\nWe extend congratulations to Edi\ntor Whitten and his force and wish\nthem much continued success. The\nMarion Progress has had a leading\npart in the rapid growth of that sec\ntion of our great state. — Ruther\nford News.\nLaughing Around the World\nWith IRVIN S. COBB\nImported from the Mother Country\nBy IRVIN S. COBB\n'T'O MY way of thinking, Punch is perhaps the finest humorous publi\ncation in the world. Punch sometimes may seem rather sad. Once\nin awhile you strike a dull number of it, but, consider its work for a\nyear, and take into consideration the fact that it has been printing work\nof equal merit for a very great number of years and the record it covers\nis untouchable, I think, on this earth.\nThe wit of the London street is not to be duplicated anywhere —\ncertainly not in our own largest city—of New York. The New York\nloafer excels in profanity, perhaps, but there his supremacy ends. For\nhumorous observation he is not to be mentioned in the same breath with\nthe native Londoner.\nWe are expected to imagine a village green in the morning. The\nofficial drunkard is revealed in the foreground. It is evident that he\nhas had a hard night. He leans against the village pump, pressing his\nthrobbing temples to the cool iron work. Ambling up to him with a\nsmile of gratification on his chubby cheeks, comes the curate of the\nparish.\n\"Good morning, Walker,\" says the curate briskly.\n\"Mornin',\" says Walker, opening one eye wanly but not shifting\nhis position.\n\"Walker,\" continues the curate, \"I want to tell you that I was most\npleased — although, I must confess, a bit surprised as well — to see you\nam one those present at vesper services last evening.\"\n\"Ow,\" says Walker, \"so that's where I was, was I?\"\n(American News Features, Inc.)\nNOTES AND COMMENTS\nMarion might as well make up its\nmind to fight its own battles without\nwaiting on some industrial Santa\nClaus to furnish employment for the\npeople hare.\n* * *\nHonest merchants will not take\nadvantage of the faith of their cus\ntomers, because of this faith, many\nMarion merchants have had remark\nable success in their business.\n* * *\nIf everyone who received a bill on\nthe first of August had paid the\ndebt, we would have something akin\nto prosperity here in Marion.\n* * *\nAdvertising is as necessary to a\nsuccessful business as the ability to\nbuy the right thing at the right\nprice.\n* * *\nNo matter how old you are, it is\nnever too late to make a better rec\nord in life, which, after all, is the\nonly asset that really amounts to\nmuch.\n* * *\nMost unemployed men want work,\nnot charity; if you can help them by\naffording them employment, you\ndo your part; if not, don't criticize\nthem.\n*, * *\nThe mail order houses may support\nthe unemployed where their head of\nfices are, but they are doing nothing\nto help the situation in Marion.\n* * *\nA dependable newspaper has a\nprestige value that is worth money to\nany advertiser.\n•fc\nThe cry of most taxpayers is \"Cut\nexpenses, but don't lop off anything\nthat will affect me or mine.\"\n❖ * *\nWhat the business and industrial\nworld needs today, as much as any\nthing else, is common honesty.\nHOW TO SAVE LIVES\nThousands of persona are killed\nevery year in the United States in\nautomobile accidents.\nMany of these accidents could\nhave been avoided if the operators\nof one of the vehicles involved had\npracticed some courtesy in driving\nor had hot been in such a big hurry\nto get nowhere in particular.\nJust why an ordinary intelligent\ncitizen becomes obsessed with a de\nsire to \"set a record\" when he puts\nhis hands on a steering wheel is a\npuzzle, the solution of which will de\ncrease highway fatalities.\n\"A friend in the market is better than\nmoney in the chest.\"\nAUGUST\nJsEL\nfc—The steamer \"Alaska\"\nwas wrecked, 1921.\n7—U.

Paul A. Boriack, B. D.,\nPastor St. Matthew's Luth\neran Church, Marion, N. C.\nIt seems to be a natural trait of\nj manknd to want to enjoy life but\nnot to want to suffer. Even in a lit\ntle child this tendency asserts itself.\nYet in spite of that man is often\nstubbornly self-willed and thereby\ncauses himself and others untold\nsuffering. Such suffering often be\ncomes man's greatest blessing if cor\nrectly interpreted and its wisdom i\nheeded. We take liberty to quote;\nfrom an editorial: But Deliver Us\nfrom Evil. j\n\"From our own experience and\nj that of others, we see when things\ni go according to man's will, he be\n' comes secure, wilful, conceited and\n; obstinate; he is apt to abuse his\nj good fortune and exalt himself above\nj his fellows. But when trials, afflic\ntions and sorrows come upon him, he\nj becomes humble and obedient. A\nj father will chastise his child when\n! necessary in order to make it obedi\nent and faithful, and so God chas\ntens us in order to make us better\nand nobler Christians. Therefore\nDavid says: 'It is good for me that I\nhave been afflicted, that I might learn\nThy Statutes.' For this reason Isaiah\nsays: 'Lord, in trouble have\nthey visited thee; they poured out a\nj prayer when Thy chastening was up\non them.' For this reason we read in\nHebrews: 'God chasteneth us for our\nI profit, that we might be partakers of\nHis holiness.. Now, no chastening for\nthe present seemeth joyous, but\ngrievous; nevertheless, afterward it\nyieldeth the peaceable fruit of\nj righteousness unto them which are\nexercised thereby.' For this reason\nj St. Paul says: 'We glory in tribula\ntions also; knowing that tribulation\n| worketh patience, and patience, ex\nperience, and experience, hope; and\n. hope maketh not ashamed.' God sends\nus these crosses and turns them to\nour benefit and we should be patient,\nsubmissive, and resigned and pray\nGod for strength to bear all.\"\nOn account of sin, selfish self-will\nof man there will be no lack of af- j\nflictions and troubles and trials. That j\nsting and curse of sin must be re- j\nmoved. To that end Christ died on\nthe Cross. Would that men could\nlook to this Crucified Christ for all\n:\nsalvation and through faith in Him\nlearn to say: Not my will, O Lord,\nbut Thine be done in all things.\nj\nPatronize home merchants.\nTALENT PACKED —One of the\ngreatest arrays of talent for a sin\nI gle show has been gathered for Ir\n| ving Berlin's\" Second Fiddle.

C.j\nthe desert sheiks used this principle\nto develop a type of hunting dog!\nthat is the fastest of all such ani\nmals, notes a writer in the Chicago j\nTribune. Tablets and other relics\nfound in ancient tombs reveal dogs\nsimilar to our Saluki, Afghan hound,\ngreyhound, and Russian wolfhound.\nThese are the fastest breeds of dog\nin the world, according to the Amer\n■ ican Kennel club.\nThe Saluki's lines are flowing from\nthe tip of his nose to the end of\nhis tail, with nowhere any defi\nnite breaks to offer wind resistance.\nThis is the breed credited with\nbeing the only dog fast enough to\nbring down a gazelle, supposedly\nthe fastest of all wild animals. The\nothers, the Afghan hound, the grey\nhound, and the Russian wolfhound,\nare very similar in conformation.\nThat the ancient Persians, Arabian\nand Egyptians aimed to breed such\nlines is evident, for these hunting\nbreeds were the only dogs allowed\ninside tents and houses. Other dogs\nof those days were stoned away.\nThe dog of the vikings, the Nor\nwegian elkhound, dates back to 4500\nB. C., but this is a sturdier animal,\nbred for strength to cope with heav\nier, slower quarry. The Maltese, a\ntiny lapdog, is traced back to the\nisland of Melita in 3500 B. C. The\nchow chow, the Great Dane, and the\nmastiff, all hunters in the past, were\nfirst noted in 3000 B. C., at which\ntime those toys, the Pekingese and\nthe pug, also appeared.\nDiscovery of New World\nHeld Boon to Botanists\nThe discovery and subsequent ex\nploration of the New World made\nknown to botanists many new and\ninteresting, as well as economically\nimportant, forms of vegetation on\nthe continents of North and South\nAmerica. One great group that was\nalmost unknown to civilization be\nfore that time is the cactus family,\nwrites E. C. Hummel in Nature\nMagazine. One genus, Rhipsalis, is\nrepresented by a species found na\ntive to Africa, where it grows on the\ntrunks and branches of trees. Hav\ning white, glutinous berries it has\nbeen given the common name \"mis\ntletoe cactus.\" How it crossed the\nAtlantic is one of the botanical mys\nteries, but many believe it was car\nried by birds from the American\ncontinent.\nThe cactus family consists of\nsome 2,000 species and varieties.\nWith their almost unlimited variety\nof form and color it is little wonder\nthey are often mistaken for stones,\nartificial ornaments, sea shell or\nfungi.\nCitric Acid\nCitric acid is a crystaline solid\nfound dissolved in lemon juice,\nwhere it is responsible for the sour\ntaste. In addition to a number of\nlesser technical uses the acid itself;\nis used to flavor prepared foods j\nand beverages, while its calcium\nsalt is extensively used in the cheese\nindustry. It has been known for\na long time that varieties of a com\nmon mold, Aspergilus niger, pro\nduce citric acid when they act on\nsugar solutions, and in recent years\nthis process has been applied to the\nlarge-scale production of the acid.\nA large part of the citric acid of\ncommerce comes from these fungi\nrather than from lemons.\nThe Thyroid Gland\nMost laymen can claim a speak\ning acquaintance with the thyroid\ngland, probably the best known\ngland of internal secretion. Its\nenlargement produces the familiar\ngoiter, states a writer in Literary\nDigest. The thyroid sits astride the\nneck, above the windpipe, pours a\nhormone (exciter) into the blood\nwhich regulates the body's energy\nproduction. Sometimes embedded in\nthe twin maroon lobes of the thyroid,\nsometimes just behind the thyroid\non the widpipe, are the parathyroid\nglands, four in number, the size of\nrice grains. Early anatomists over\nlooked them entirely or assumed\nthem to be part of the mighty thy\nroid.\nArrival of the Tuxedo\nA real change in men's evening\ndress occurred in the elegant '80s.\nIt was then that the tuxedo made\nits appearance in New York pleas\nure halls, where the Cloth Spongers'\nsociety, the Buttonhole Makers' un\nion, the Plumbers' Helpers' coterie,\nand others disported themselves.\nHei^e it was worn in conjunction\nwith embroidered shirt fronts, white\nsatin waistcoats, and ties, and dia\nmond studs. The term tuxedo was\nan inspiration of cheap tailors, co\nincident with the rise of the ex\nclusive resort founded by Pierre\nLorillard.\n\"Comin' Through the Rye\"\nMuch controversy has arisen over\nthe reference of the song, \"Comin'\nThrough tire Rye.\" It has often\nbeen illustrated by a waving field\nof rye, and the manufacturers of\na celebrated brand of rye whiskey\nhave used such an illustration show\ning the lovers in a rye field. But the\nfull significance of the song, accord\ning to a writer in the Cleveland\ni Plain Dealer, is apparent after\n! reading of the custom that estab\nlished a toll of kisses to be exacted\nfrom lassies who were met in cross\n; ing the River Rye on stepping\n! stones.\nTAR HEEL P^POLEES\nMAKING GOOD RECORD\nRaleigh, June 12.— Paroles Com\nmissioner Edwin Gill reported to\nGovernor Hoey today that less than\n10 per cent of the 1,481 persons on\nparole from North Carolina prisons\nwere unemployed.\nThe average salary of those hav\ning jobs is $33.84 a month, Gill said.\nHe added that if earnings continued\nat that rate, \"our active roster will\nearn approximately $547,000 annu\nally.\"\nOnly 54 of the persons on parole\nwork for the WPA or other federal\nrelief agencies, the commissioner\nsaid; 132 are unemployed; and 1,295\nhave private employment. The jobs\nrange from merchant to floorwalker,\nfrom housewife to washerwoman,\nfrom professional baseball player to\nhouse boy, from civil engineer to\ncemetery keeper.\nA total of 153 are employed as\ncommon laborers and 153 others as\nfarm laborers. Nine are fishermen;\n105 are tenant farmers; 12 are car\npenters; 80 work in textile factories;\n28 are loggers; 22 work in service\ndrive trucks; 22 work in service\nstations; 20 are salesmen.\nEvery year, Gill said, hundreds of\nmen and women on parole \"gradu\nate\" to citizenship.\n\"The pifblic hears much about pa\nrole failure and little about parole\nsuccess, and yet there is much of\nsolid accomplishment in the story\nthat we have to tell,\" the commis\nsioner said.\nIRISH POTATO SHIPMENTS\nMAY REACH 7,500 CARLOADS\nRaleigh, N. C., June 10. — North\nCarolina early potato growers will\nship approximately 7,500 carloads\nbefore July 1, R. B. Etheridge,\nchief of the State Department of Ag\nriculture's markets division, said to\nday, basing his information on a\nsurvey of commercial shippers.\n\"Approximately 85 per cent of\nthe potato crop this year will be in\nspected by the 140 graders of the\nDepartment, operating at every ship\nping point,\" Etheridge said.\nHeavy rains in the potato produc\ning sections materially reduced the\nshipments during the week ending\nMay 28, but with favorable weather\nthis week the carlot shipments\nshould be fairly heavy and the peak\nshould be reached before June 15.\"\nEtheridge said that prices receiv\ned this year \"while at a low level,\nshowed an increase over last year\nand those close to the industry feel\nthat prices will be better for the en\ntire season than prices paid last\nyear.\"\nLARGEST WHEAT CROP\nON RECORD FORECAST\nWashington, June 10.— The agri\nculture department forecast today\na 1938 American wheat crop of be\ntween 1,020,623,000 and 1,045,623,\n000 bushels—the largest ever recor\nded.\nThe largest previous crop was 1,\n008,637,000 bushels, in 1915.\nThe estimate, including both win\nter and spring wheat, was based on\ncoindition of the crops June 1.\nA crop such as the department\nforecast, added to the estimated sur\nplus of 200,000,000 bushels from\nlast year, would give the nation a\ntotal supply of 1,220,000,000 or\nmore bushels, or about 500,000.000\nbushels more than normal needs.\nSuch a surplus would be the largest\non record.\nTHE ANSWERS\n1.

(UP)\nA bloc of conservative southern\nDemocrats, led by Representatives\nMartin Dies of Texas and E. Eu\ngene Cox of Georgia, are seeking\nsupporters in a drive to deliver\nimportant house committee posts\nto anti-New Deal congressmen, it\nwas learned last night.\nDetermined to play an increas\ningly important role in the 7f>th\ncongress, Dies and Cox, who ac\ntively opposed the wage-hour bill\nlast session, consider sweeping\nRepublican gains in the fall elec\n, tion as a protest against Presi\ndent Roosevelt's policies, and feel\nthat the Democratic party must\n■ steer a more conservative course\n! if it is to retain majority support\n! throughout the nation.\nThe two have been active in\n: contacting 4 fellow southerners,\nl who hold 115 of the 262 house\nDemocratic seats, in an effort to\n; gain their united support in the I\ndrive for committee control. At\nthe same time they have been\nplaying up to the conservative\n; element in northern Democratic j\nranks' in order to obtain the -ad\nditional 24 Democratic votes nec\n1 essary to give their bloc a ma-:\njority vote in party strategy.\nThe struggle will come into\nthe open next Monday in a pre\nsession Democratic caucus in\nwhich majority members of the\npowerful 25-man ways and means |\ncommittee will be selected, as;\nwell as the speaker and majority\nleader. Membership in this key\ncommittee will indicate the future !\nset-up of other groups, since ways;\nand means members draft the\nslates of the. remaining commit\ntee. These subsequently are rati- j\nfied at another caucus.\nRe-election of Speaker William |\nB. Bankhead, D., Ala., and Ma-1\nj.ority Leader Sam Rayburn, D.,\nTex., is a foregone conclusion.\nThe struggle for control will cen-1\nter around the make-up of the1\nways and means group, which this !\nyear will consist of 15 Democrats\nand 10 Republicans. Last session\nthere were 18 Democrats and sev\nen Republicans, but the latter\nparty's off-year gains will in-1\ncrease its membership in the\ngroup.\nUnder the circumstances, Dies\nand Cox are said to feel that con\n! servative Democrats need but a\nsmall membership to obtain their\nobjective, since they can work in\nconcert with Republicans to as\ni sure anti-administration action.\nOutcome of the drive, however,\nwill depend almost entirely on\ni support from their northern col\nleagues and unitv of the southern\ndelegation. Many veteran poli\nticians consider it improbable\nthat Dies and Cox can achieve\ntheir objective, since there is\nsome New Deal strength within\n(Continued on Dage three)\ni Highway Carnage Is Reduced For\ni 13th Continuous Month; See Deaths\nFor Year Lowered At Least 7,000\nCHICAGO, Dec. 29.

H£IL\nSTERN ADOLF!\nU \" (By BRUCE CATTON)\nThe Nazis have finally extended their j\nbenign guidance to what used to be Aus\ntria and gay, dreamy Vienna henceforth\nmay be about as gay and dreamy as Phil\nadelphia on a dreary winter Sunday.\nOne of the major tragedies of the Hit\nlei ization of little Austria is the certainty\nthat the be-good-or-be-beaten discipline\nthat the Nazis so dearly love will be im\nposed on her capital. Vienna, where for\nmany centures good food, beautiful wo\nmen and gay dancing have been consider\ned among the most important things in\nlife, may feel the puritanical influence of!\nthe Nazi reform mania.\nWiener schnitzel will be broiled in some\nimitation butter, because the Nazis must;\nhave guns instead of butter. The beauti-l\nful- women will be sent to camps to learn!\nfarm work or they may be told that their\nplace is forever in the home, for they must\nbe ready to do their solemn bit when the\nbig war comes.\nLeisure, long looked upon as an art in\nVienna, will of course be something to be\nforgotten for there can be no unemploy\nment—much less anything like leisure—in\na Nazi state. In short, the Viennese must\nstop having fun and be quick about de\ndicating their lives to the greater glory of j\nHerr Hitler and his ideas of how the i\nworld should be rui\\.\nIn this hefuddled world the Nazis are!\ntrue missionaries. Nothing makes a goodl\nstorm trooper happier than the knowledge\nthat he has changed'the way of living of\nsome erring soul and brought to him the\nstern light of national socialism. And\nright there you have the aspect of Nazism\nthat is more irritating to a lot of people\nthau the more sinister phases of the move\nment.\nThe Gerjaans used to be just about the\nworld's jolliest people. It was a rare Ger\nman indeed who was not dominated by the\nspirit of gemuetlichkeit. But Uerr Hitler\napparently has changed them into a na\ntion of crusading zealots.\nNot long ago it was even decreed that\nthe.Germans would consume no bock beer\nthis spring. Got away with it, too. What\never you think of Der Fuehrer you must\nadmit that he accomplishes things no man\never dared dream before the advent of the\nNazi regime.\nBat when Herr Hitler finally gets every\ning he wants—which is quite a bit—what\nthen? Will the German people behappy?\nOrdinary human beings—and that is just\nexactly what the Germans fundamentally\nare—asking more pleasure of life than the\nNazis are willing to permit.\nSo for the present: Iteil Hitler, Vienna,\nand'forget all those champagne parties,\ngrand bails, and the light and carefree\nspirit th,at made you. famous. As the cap\nital of a Nazi state you now have a mis\nsion, and the fulfillment of that mission\nleaves no room for the enjoyment of living.\nA group of youths picketed a Detroit bil\nliard hali in protest against \"poor loafing\nconditions.'* Apparently the pool room\noperator thinks he's running a business.\n•\ntVhat is the world coming to?

Anywav, no city of\nthe South set up such howls for relief in 1805 as\nare going up from New York, Boston, Cleveland,\nPittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and fifty\nother Big Towns in Northern states.\n^ Our people are doing their utmost to relieve the\nNorthern misery; they are paying taxes as never\nbefore to help them and are quietly submitting to\npayment by the federal government of double the\nwages to their \"reliefers\" as are paid to their own.\nEvery one seems to understand that the big city\nrents must be paid as long as the Roosevelt admin\nistration can sell bonds to the people who have\nmoney to buy bonds. Mighty few of that kind of\npeople live In these parts. Nine hundred and\nninety-nine in a thousand of the South Carolina\nkind of people pay interest on United States bonds\nand own none.—Charleston News and Courier.\nHAVE THE DICTATORS DIVIDED THE SPOILS?\nA world that has been wondering why Mussolini\nsat so iferenely by and watched bk brother-dictator\nin Germany take Austria, a next-door neighbor of\nItaly, may now find at least whispers of the ans\nwer in the situation developed in Spain.\nMussolini would, doubtless, be willing to call it\na good bargain should Hitler have offered to allow\nhim to passess Spain in exchange for Italian\nacquiescence in the rape of Austria.\nHitler, at any rate, seems to have assumed the\nsole power, all of a sudden, of determining the\nnew boundaries of the future may of Europe.\nHe is the Bib Boss who is distributing favors as\nwell as asking no quarter in his rutfcjess and relent\nless rush to seize countries needed for the estab\nlishment of a Pan-Germanic empire.\nIt is unthinkable that Mussolini should have re\nmained complacent in the face of the history-mak\ning coups of the German monarch except that, by\nsecret trade, he has already been allotted a share\nthat satisfies his own hoggish imperalisms.—Char\nlotte Observer.\nA GOOD MAN PASSES\nPlato Durham Heffner died yesterday at his\nhome in Spartanburg after a long illness. He had\nbeen in business more than fifty years and half of\nthat time was spent in this city, where he was at\nthe head of a business he organized. Mr. Heffner\nwas a loyal and progressive citizen. He always\nwas ready to respond to any request for his ser\nvices to advance the interests of his community.\nHe was a leader in the affairs of the First Presby\nterian Church and was honored by the congrega\ntion.\nP. D. Heffner had the respect of all with whom\nhe came in contact in business. He was popular\nwith all classes of people. He was one who enjoy\ned life and valued the friendships he made.

His exemplification of cour\nage and cheer in a trying time has set a tone for\npopular thinking. He has brought a social\nsympathy and an awareness of the problems of\nthe less fortunate and of this the nation stood\nin need. He has tackled stupendous problems\nwith a light-heartedness that sometimes opproach\ned irresponsibility, and his methods have seldom\nbeen as good as his motives nor his carry through\nas good as his vision.—Greenville Piedmont.\nTHE CONVICTIONS OF FREEDOM\nNothing can keep a nation free except the con\nviction of its people that they would rather die\nthan be slaves. Freedom is not a gift but a vic\ntory, and in the crisis of a nation's life, at its\nfounding and when its existence is threatened,\nthere is no substitute for heroism. Political\nmaneuvers, alliances, pacts and the compromises of\nordinary public life are of no avail when a people\nstands at its Thermopylae and the ultimate issue\nof the life or death of a nation is joined. For\nwhile heroes have often been defeated, in the great\ncrisis only heroes can prevail.—Walter Lippman in\nThe Charlotte Observer.\nTHE THUGGISM OF NAZIS\nIn this modern \"civilization\" nothing is quite so\ndisgraceful and idiotic as the persecution of the\nJewish people by the Nazis. In proportion to pop\nulation the number of Jews in South Carolina prob\nably approximates the number in Austria.

But the State Depart- !\nment, which loves the game, can\nhardly dare make the point that\n; ''it's the only game in town.\"\nSimplification of the European\nsituation is riskier than it is sim\nple. It would be much easier if |\none could accept the current offi- '\n:ial diplomatic view in Washing- j\nI ton that the \"Rome-Berlin axis\" !\nlas been busted by Hitler's an\nlexation of Austria. The plain\nfact, however, is that no one can\n-ell from this distance how tight i\ns the bond between Hitler and\nMussolini or how bright are Eng\nland's chances of severing that\nbond.\nThis government has confiden\ntial advices—which it believes\n—that active Nazi penetration\nof Austria which began when\nHitler summoned Chancellor\nSchuschnigg to a conference in !\nFebruary, was a surprise to Mus\nrolini and that the Duce knew\nnothing of the conference until he 1\nread about it in the newspapers.\nOfficials believe that Mussolini\nfears Hitler—now that German\niroops are at the Brenner Pass— ,\n; that the interests of Hitler and :\n1 Mtsssolini conflict, that Italy wants\nand needs a Mediterranean agree- j\n' jnent with England more than I\nanytmng else ana mat Mussolini\nregards prospective German pene\ntration into Czechoslovakia and\nthe Balkans as a menace to her.\nConsequently, they infer, it will\nbe easy for the Chamberlain gov\nernment to work out an agree\nment with Mussolini on the Medi\nterranean situation and then to\nplay off Italy against Germany.\nThe old British game of play\ning both ends against the middle\nwas at least temporarily inter\nrupted when Hitler and Mussolini\ndecidcd that they could and' would\nput England herself in the middle.\nThis arrangement blossomed in\nto an \"anti-Communist\" pact with\nJapan which caused Britain si\nmultaneously to worry about Ger\nman air raids, control of the Medi\nterranean and her \"life line\" to\nIndia and her interests in the Far\nEast. It bloomed into a climax,\nat least according to certain like\nly grapevine reports, when Ger\nmany and Italy both refused to\nenter into any \"appeasement\" ne\ngotiations with England until Sir\nAnthony Eden resigned as for\neign minister.\nNot everyone in the State De\npartment is so naive as to believe\nthat Italy will now decide to part\ncompany with Nazi Germany and\ncast in her lot with England in re\nturn for certain not too vital con\ncessions. There are those who be\nlieve that Hitler and Mussolini\nlong ago agreed that Germany\nshould have Austria and that Italy\nshould have Spain—and, in each\ncase, goodness knows how much\nmore territory.\nNothihg is proved except the\nfact that the United States, with\nfew if any chips on the table as\nyet, jusc doesn't know what's hap\npening. or what's about to happen\nin Europe and presumably should\nstay out of the game.\niCoDvritrht. 1928.

This\nadministration is not of the Democratic Party in\nthat sense. Jim Farley no longer run; the party,\nTommy Corcoran has a greater voice. The reor\nganization bill was not a Democratic Party meas\nure. It was one of six similar Cohen-Corcoran bills\nthat were cooked up to be bum's-rushed through\nCongress to change fundamentally democratic in\nstitutions and government.\nThe President's attitude toward the Democratic\nParty was plain in his speech in Gainesville, in\nwhich he intimated that the South is under the\nfeudal system. That referred to low wages and\ntenant farmers. Both conditions ai;e bad. But nei\nther the President nor anybody else can wave a\nwand to change it. The South didn't invent the\ncondition. It was forced by Northern bayonets in\nthe destruction of the Civil War and the terrible\nyears of \"Reconstruction\" when one section of the\ncountry sought to exploit another as \"conquerea\nprovinces.\"\nBetter conditions are coining, but they come\nslowly. In most low-wage Southern industry, mar\nkedly higher wages would simply close up the shop\nand throw the workers on the street. That was\ndemonstrated over and over again in NRA.\nThis is part of the problem of the Democratic\nParty of the South—a party suspected or con\ndemned, and, in either case, kicked all over the\nlot by this administration. The two-thirds rule in\nnominations was there to protect Southern Democ\nracy.\nThe Corcoran-Cohen type of party control abol\nished it.

That is the plan\nof government where the country is owned by the\nking and local governors hold office at his pleas\nure—do what he te'.is them to do—or else.—Gen.\nHugh Johnson in Charlotte News.\nTHE PROBLEM OF RELIEF\nFinancial experts of the country are warning\nthat if relief expenditures continue at the current\nrate cities as well as the federal government will\ngo bankrupt.\nThey point out that measures must be found\nto reduce the staggering burden of relief which\nsince 1933 has cost the federal gobernment more\nthan $14,000,000,000 and the states and local com\nmunities over $5,000,000,000.\nOn the other hand, >ocial workers of the coun\ntry assert that standaris of relief are too low and\nthat large numbers o.\" \"eligible\" persons are in\nneed but are unable to secure relief because of\nquota restrictions.\nSo it seems that in spite of the fact that for\nhalf a decade relief funds have been provided at\na rate calculated to \"break\" the country only a\nportion of the demands have been met.\nIt becomes clearer each day that the relief prob\nlem will not be solved by the simple process of\nappropriating funds from the public treasury. And\nit becomes more clearly evident that the problem,\nhas assumed proportions that can no longer be con\nsidered lightly.—Greenville Piedmant.\nWHY WOULD THIS NOT ALSO HAPPEN?\nIt used to be that if special creature needs de\nveloped in a community, that community rushed\nto the rescue.\nIt may have been a precinct or a township or\na county or a State thus moved into action, but, j\nwhichever it was, local attention and local support\nhandled the job.\nNow everything in a relief way is headed out >\nfrom Washington whence issues, also, the vast pre\nponderance of the funds allocated to this neces-1\nsary and humane cause.\nThe charity and philanthropy which formerly\nwere called into action from the citizen of an in\ndividual community have dried up.\nWhat's the use of a local patriot bleeding him\nself white in sympathy for his fellows next doort\nwhen Washington has all the money that seems to\nbe needed for this purpose?\nIsn't it likely that similar reactions might be\nsuffered when the Federal government goes into\nthe business of financing public education?\nIf Washington has the money with which to edu\ncate the boys and girls of a township or a county\nor a State, why should the tax payers of the town\nship or the county or the State be pestered any\nfurther with local tax burdens for such services?\n—Charlotte Observer.\nDOWN THEIR ALLEY\nIf liquor dealers of South Carolina, wholesale\nand retail, wish to avoid a return to prohibition\nthey could take no better step than to organize\neffective assistance to law eforcement officers in\nthe elimination of bootlegging.\nMany citizens voted for repeal in the belief that\nbootlegging and its attendant evils would be re\nduced to a minimum. They have been disappointed.\nIt has been reduced but not to the extent de\nsired, it being common knowledge that great quan\ntities of liquor, both tax-paid and illicit, are being\nsold by this means. In one county, Anderson, the\nsheriff is quoted as expressing the opinion that\nbootleg sales there exceed legal, sales.\nIt is not the responsibility of legal liquor deal\ners any more than of other citizens to assist in\n! eliminating bootlegging but they have more at\nstake from a material viewpoint and it would be\nbut natural for them t9 do what they could legally\nto prolect their interests.\nStamping out bootlegging would go far in that\ndirection .—-Greenville Piedmont, -\nFREEDOM IN THE REICH\nFrom Germany comes the report that four mem\n| bers of a Bible Society have been sentenced to\nterms ranging from six months to three and a\nha^f years fof saying they would not vote in the\nforthcoming plebiscite.\nI Vpting. the leader explained, would be contrary\nto their principles.

Later\nthey moved to Lynchburg, Va.,\nwhere Ed attended school, reach\ning the fourth grade, which was\nthe extent of his schooling. The\nfamily then moved to Winston-Sa\nlem, where he remained for about\n15 years. His father, who remar\nried, is now an invalid, living at 717\nGoldfloss Street, Winston-Salem.\nOne brother, J. D. Hull, is married\nand lives in the Same city. Anoth\ner brother, B. W. Hull, lives with\nhis father. His mother, before\nmarriage, was Georgia Brannock,\nof Forsyth county.\nHull’s wife, before marriage a\nbout two years ago, was Sara Ste\ngall, who lived near Kernersville.\nThey have no children. Their home\nis a small one, in the King Tut\ncommunity, about two miles from\nAsheboro.\n“I appreciate the check, but\nrather have my regular job back,”\nsaid Hull. He said that the plant\nwas resuming work gradually and\nthat he hoped to get back on the\npayroll soon. He did not make e\nnough in the two quarters he\nworked to provide him compensa\ntion for the full maximum of 16\nweeks in any benefit year.\nJames Council spent Sunday in\nRocky Mount.\nMr. and Mrs. S.

GAY TO MAKE\nOPENING ADDRESS\nON SEPTEMBER 6\nSchool Will Have Thir\nteen Teachers In\nSystem\nGaston High School will begin its\n1939-1940 session on Wednesday\nmorning, Sept. 6. Opening exer\ncises will be held in the auditorium\nat nine o’clock, to which the public\nis cordially invited. A. C. Gay of\nJackson, former State Senator and\nmember of the State School Com\nmission, will be the principal\nspeaker on this occasion. I\nIt is earnestly hoped that every\npupil will be present on the open\ning day and will attend regularly\nthroughout the session. As the\nschool lacked an average daily at\ntendance of only six last session\nof being entitled to an additional\nteacher, the enrollment of all chil\ndren who should be in school and\ntheir regular attendance during the\nfirst month would probably make\nit possible to secure an extra teach\ner for the present session.\nAll of last year’s teachers will be\nback for the coming session ex\ncept Mrs. V. T. Cordle, teacher of\nthe seventh grade, who was not a\ncandidate for re-election. Mrs. T.\nL. O’Briant, a former very success\nful teacher in the Roanoke Rapids\nschools, will hold the position for\nmerly held by Mrs. Cordle. A com\nplete list of the teachers follows:\nFirst grade—Miss Sarah Moss,\nEmporia, Va.; second grade—Mrs.\nB. R. Bullock, Seaboard, N. C.;\nthird grade—Mrs. B. H. Johnson,\nRoanoke Rapids, N.

About planting trees?\nAbout winter cover crops and le\ngumes?\nWhat is the significance of deep\ngullies which mar the landscape of\nNorth Carolina? The rivers that\nrun red after heavy rains? The\nchannels of streams that become\nshallow?\nE. Y. Floyd, AAA executive of\nficer of State College, supplies the\nanswers with data collected\nthrough a recent reconnaissance e\nrosion survey of North Carolina.\nIt showed that 1,410,490 of the 31,\n276,299 acres of land in the State\nexclusive of large cities and water\nways, has been essentially destroy\ned for tillage by erosion. That is\n4.5 of the crop land.\nThe survey further revealed that\n12,187,44d, or 30 per cent of the\nfarm land, has been affected by\nerosion, and that 9 per cent has\nlost over three-fourths of its top\nsoil and some subsoil. That was\nonly through sheet erosion.\nA total of 5,647,540 acres, or 18.1\nper cent of the land, has been af\nfected by gullying, or severe ero\nsion.\n“This is one of the major prob\nlems with which the Triple-A farm\nprogram is concerned, and it is one\nof the reasons why the government\nis offering farmers cash payments\nto conserve and build up the fer\ntility of their soil through the\nplanting and turning under of le\ngumes, the planting of forest trees,\nterracing and the use of certain\nsoil-building materials such as\nphosphate and lime,” Floyd declar\ned.\nHe urged that farmers carry out\nenough soil-building practices to\nearn their maximum payments this\nyear, and that if there is any doubt\nin any person’s mind about any\nphase of t he program, that he get\nin touch with his county farm\nagent immediately.\nVestry To Meet\nThe Vestry of All Saints Episco\npal Church will meet in regular\nsession Tuesday evening, Septem\nber the fifth, at 7:30.

W.\nDavis, Tuesday of this week. Im\nmediately after the general meet\ning Mr. and Mrs. Davis will have\nas their guests all the returned\nteachers and friends of the school\nat a watermelon party in the\nlunch room of the junior high\nbuilding, carrying out an annual\ncustom.\nFriday afternoon, September 1,\na meeting of all the high school\nteachers and principals will be\ncalled in the library of the high\nschool building. Saturday morning\nwill be taken up with various de\npartmental meetings.\nMr. Davis states that at the pres\nent time the schools have suffi\ncient space to accommodate all the\nexpected pupils. If present calcu\nlations are correct, there will be\nno children who will have to attend\nhalf-days as was the case last year.\nThe new building which was fin\nished near the close of school last\nyear makes it possible for all chil\ndren to attend on regular sched\nules.\nGovernment\nHelps Tenants\nBuy Farm\nOne fact of vital importance to\nbusiness men in agricultural com\nmunities that has been obscured\nby the headlines on the spending\nlending bill is that the government\nthis year has another $40,000,000 to\nhelp competent farm tenants,\nsharecroppers and farm laborers to\npurchase their own farms. This\n$75,000,000 in the last two years\nearmarked for the drive to stem\nthe impoverishment of landlords,\ntenants and land. Thus far more\nthan 6,000 farms have been bought\nunder the plan, at an average cost\nof $5,000 each, with the loans run\nning for a 40-year period. The new\nlife given to these farmers has\nbrought needed strength to the\npurchasing power of their commu\nnities. That there is still a long\ndistance to go in the program ia\nindicated by the fact that two out\nof every five farmers are tenants,\nfarming land they do not own.\nA Better Method\nVOU CANNOT deposit\n\"your buildings, house\nhold goods, automobile or\nmerchandise in the bank!\nBut you can protect your in\nvestment in all these valu\nables by insuring them.\nThere is no safeguard more\neffective than a policy issued\nby a strong dependable in\nsurance company.\nNATIONAL\nLoan & Insurance Co. lHC*\n12 W.

Wonder if the country folks would\nhave stood for regimentation if the relief programs\nhad not cushioned their fall?\" .. . .\nThe curtailment of cotton and other farm crops\nmeans that many of these folks who formerly made\ntheir' living* on the farm will now be on relief.\nThey will1 flock from the farms to the towne and\ncities and add to the long list of unemployed in\nthe larger centers. • • • ?

SUBSIDIZING DEPRESSION\nWith one hand the Roosevelt Administration is\nworking-to--make peace with the public utilities and\nencourage in*estme«* in a field which might he the\nstarter, for btosineas redovetj*. The RFC. u fan\nning federal loans for-utility construction., The\nSBC is -trying to work- out the holding company\nact bo a# to damage as little as possible companies\nwhich miwt be disentangled. The TVA is negotiat\ning for purchase of private holdings subject to its\ncompetition.\nThis whole effort seems to be to limit govern-'\nment competition, establishing conditions of cer- j\ntainty and prospects for reasonable profit on in\nvestment*. Under such conditions there is hope,\nthat billions of dollars and thousands of men\nwould be employed in delayed construction of\nneeded power plants and transmission lines. This\nhas seemed the most promising kind of pump prim\ning. - •«\nBut with its other hand the Administration is\npushing a spending-lending bijl which would give\ncities PWA funds up to 45 per cent of the cost of\nmunicipal electric plants. • Thus it is subsidizing\ngovernmental competition in the very same field\nin which it is trying to remove fears of govern\nment competition and encourage private invest\nment* I i\nThis is not fair yardstick competition. It is set\nting up governmental monopoly, blocking recovery\ninvestment, and subsidizing the destruction of pres\nent utility values. If that is what the left hand\nmeans, why not-lot-the right hand know it? Or if\nthat is not what the administration's policy in con-i\ngvess means, why not explain t<* the country?—\nChristian Science Monitor.\n$10,000 FARMS FOR SS.OOO ' .\n!'
