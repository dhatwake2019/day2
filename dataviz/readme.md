#### Hierarchy (Tree Map) Chart
Let's say we're interested in the demographic breakdown of the people interviewed by:

1. Click 'New' under Visualizations
2. Scroll down and click on 'Hierarchy'
3. Click on the Data tab at the top and then 'Import your data' (or drag your file in)
4. On the right, it will ask what columns you want to visualize. Let's try @@ add letters from final export@@  interviewer, race_interviewee, gender_interviewee@@ and remove the ltter in 'Size by'. No click on 'Preview' in the top.
5. Take a moment to see what's being visualized here. Try selecting different Layouts—in addition to Treemap, there's also Circles, Sunburst, and Bar.
6. Notice that gender isn't shown—try playing with the 'Visible levels' and seeing if that helps.
7. Take a moment to look through the different features in the pop-out menu to style your visualization.
7. Give it a name on the top left—maybe 'NC-interviewerdemos'
8. When you're happy with it, click on 'Export & Publish' in the top right—you can publish this and embed or link to it, or download it as a PNG, JPG, or SVG in your preferred size.

#### Alluvial Chart
Let's say we want to see if the interviewers had a particular territory, or if multiple interviewers went in and out of the same cities:

1. Click 'New' under Visualizations
2. Scroll down and click on the 'Sankey Diagram - Default' options
3. Click on the Data tab at the top and then 'Import your data' (or drag your file in)
4. On the right, it will ask what columns you want to visualize. Let's try @@@interviewer@@ in 'Source' and @@ City@@ in 'Target.' Be sure to delete the next input, since we don't have an integer we want to measure.
5. It looks like there are very few times where a city had more than one interviwer. Let's try county to see if that holds up. @@@switch letter@@
6. Give this one a name—maybe 'Sankey-location' and click on the back arrow to return to the homepage.
